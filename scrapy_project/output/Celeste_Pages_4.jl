Below is a list of chapters, collectables, and other phenomena found within vanilla Celeste.\n\"Sides / Chapters\" \u00a0- Each chapter in Celeste refers to a playable location such as Old Site (Chapter 2) or Mirror Temple (Chapter 5). Each chapter has an A-Side, B-Side, and C-Side, except for Chapter 9, Farewell. These can be abbreviated with the suffix of -A, -B, and -C respectively. For example, Forsaken City A-Side is 1A, and Golden Ridge B-Side is 4B. For more information, see the  List of Celeste Chapters .\n- \u201cA-side\u201d - The A-side of the chapter is the primary part of the chapter. Between A-sides, B-sides, and C-sides, A-sides are the easiest but longest, and are the only \u2018side\u2019 with any bearing on the plot. Along with strawberries, each A-side has a collectable hidden cassette tape as well as a blue crystal heart which often requires puzzle-solving.\n- \u201cB-side\u201d - B-sides are an unlockable challenge version of a chapter, significantly more difficult than the A-side. B-sides are non-canon and have no collectable strawberries besides the ubiquitous golden strawberry. Each B-side ends with a collectable red crystal heart.\n- \u201cC-side\u201d - C-sides are the final unlockable \u2018side\u2019 of a chapter, and are harder than B-sides. Each C-side is generally three rooms long, with the final room being the most difficult, making C-sides the shortest chapters in Celeste. Like B-sides, they are non-canon and have no collectable strawberries. Each C-side ends with a collectable yellow crystal heart.\nPrologue and Epilogue are chapters without alternate sides or collectables, they aren't shown in the Journal, and they have no abbreviation, as they are very short and lack any significant challenge.\n\u201cCassette\u201d  - Every chapter A-side contains a collectable cassette found in a hidden room. These hidden rooms play a chip-tune music track in the background and have \u2018cassette blocks\u2019 which activate and deactivate in rhythm with the music. \u00a0Collecting a cassette unlocks the B-side of the chapter.\n\u201cCrystal Heart\u201d  - Floating heart shaped crystals with one found in each chapter. A-sides have blue crystal hearts, found somewhere hidden in the level. B-sides have red crystal hearts which serve as the end goal of the chapter. Likewise, C-sides have yellow crystal hearts which serve as the end goal of the chapter. A-Side and B-Side hearts are also individually named.\n\"Farewell\" \u00a0- Chapter 9 of Celeste added in a free DLC on September 9th, 2019. It is far longer and more difficult than all other chapters of Celeste, and requires at least 15 Crystal Hearts to access any content past the Remembered checkpoint. This requirement can be bypassed with some tech usage.  The golden strawberry for this chapter, abbreviated as \"FWG\", is widely regarded as the ultimate  challenge in Celeste. The final checkpoint of Farewell is called \u2018Farewell\u2019, and to avoid confusion, this checkpoint is referred to as \"Farewell/Farewell\" or \"FWFW\".\n\u201cStrawberry\u201d \u00a0- Strawberries are Celeste\u2019s main collectible. There are 175 main strawberries that count towards 100% completing the game, plus 27 extra strawberries that do not count towards this, for a final total of 202. \u00a0Collecting six of any of these in a short period will display consecutive 1000-point rewards, starting from 1000 and increasing up to 5000, and finally displaying the text \u20181-UP\u2019 along with giving the 1UP! achievement. These points and the 1-UP are purely cosmetic, and are a reference to retro-era video games such as Super Mario World. The various types of strawberries in Celeste include:\n- \u201cRed Strawberry\u201d - The default strawberry type. Although the exact specific mechanics of these strawberries depends on the particular strawberry, most cannot be collected unless the player is standing on solid ground in a safe area. These strawberries count towards 100% completion.\n- \u201cWinged Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cwinged berry\u201d) - The second most common strawberry type. These strawberries function the same as red strawberries, with the added caveat that the strawberry will attempt to fly away if the player dashes in the room in which it is contained. These strawberries count towards 100% completion.\n- \u201cSeeded Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cstrawberry seeds\u201d, \u201cseed berry\u201d)- To collect these strawberries, the player must collect a series of strawberry seeds within a room without touching the ground, which will result in the seeds returning to their position. If successful, a cutscene will play and the seeds will manifest as a collectable red strawberry. These strawberries count towards 100% completion.\n- \u201cGolden Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cgolden\u201d) - Each of Celeste\u2019s chapters, as well as their B-sides and C-sides, has one golden strawberry, requiring the player to complete the chapter without dying to obtain, with the exception of Prologue and Epilogue. A distinct death sound will play if the player dies while carrying a golden strawberry. Each strawberry is referred to by taking the chapter\u2019s acronym and adding the suffix \u2018G\u2019; so the golden strawberry of the Chapter 1 A-side is 1AG, Chapter 4 C-side is 4CG, and of Farewell is \u201cFWG\u201d. This applies for custom maps as well. Golden strawberries become available after the player completes the chapter 8 B-side. These strawberries do not count towards 100% completion.\n- \u201cWinged Golden Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cwg \u201d or \u00a0\u201c1A dashless\u201d) - The only winged golden strawberry in the game appears at the end  of the chapter \u00a01 A-side. It can only be found if the player completes the full chapter without dashing, although the strawberry will reappear if the player dies in the same room they dashed in before completing the room. This is one of Celeste\u2019s most difficult collectibles, requiring niche techniques that are required nowhere else in the game, including corner jumps, a 6jump, and a 4-tile overhang. This strawberry does not count towards 100% completion.\n- \u201cMoonberry\u201d (aka \u201cmb\u201d or, less commonly, \u201cmerry\u201d) - The only moonberry in the game sits in a hidden room within Farewell/Farewell, which can be entered if the player backtracks after clearing the electric fields. It appears as a green strawberry with a yellow \u2018Saturn ring\u2019 around it. Upon collecting it, the usual 1000 point indicator will be replaced with the flashing text \u201cWOW\u201d. \u00a0Due to one of the rooms leading to it requiring the player to reset their respawn point and die to clear the room, it is the only collectable in the game which is completely impossible to collect without dying. Due to this, dying here while holding the golden strawberry is the only point in the game where the player will not be sent back to the beginning of the chapter when they die.  This strawberry does not count towards 100% completion.\n\u201cVariants\u201d \u00a0- A special menu unlocked after completing the C-side of Chapter 8, Core. It allows the player to change various settings about gameplay, such as the speed of time in-game a h d the amount of dashes one has. The settings are separated into two groups: variants and assists. \u00a0A full list of the settings in the variants menu is found below:\n- Variants\n- \u201cGame Speed\u201d - Controls the speed of time in-game, which affects all movement,  sounds and visuals in a level, This does not affect the chapter and file timers. The default value for this variant is 100%. The minimum is 50% and the maximum is 160%\n- \u201cMirror Mode\u201d - As its name implies, mirrors the screen in-game. Also changes the position of character portraits in dialogue boxes.\n- \u201c360 Dashing\u201d  -  Missing Descriptor\n- \u201cInvisible Motion\u201d - Madeline becomes invisible while moving, regardless if the player is holding the movement button s or not.\n- \u201cNo Grabbing\u201d - Madeline cannot grab onto walls, which makes  climbjumping \u00a0impossible. Certain blocks, such as the move blocks in Chapter 4, can still be activated by holding the grab button.\n- \u201cLow Friction\u201d - Greatly reduces Madeline\u2019s friction with the environment, making reducing her speed much more difficult.\n- \u201cSuper Dashing\u201d - Doubles the duration of Madeline\u2019s dash and gives her the ability to control the direction of her dash during one. (Not to be confused with the technique of the same name.)\n- \u201cHiccups\u201d - Madeline will start to hiccup every 1-2 seconds, causing her to be slightly launched upwards, even in mid-air.\n- \u201cOther Self\u201d - Turns Madeline into  Badeline . Purely cosmetic variant.\n- Assists\n- \u201cInfinite Stamina\u201d - Gives madeline infinite energy to climb walls.\n- \u201cAir Dashes\u201d - Changes the amount of dashes Madeline has at any time. The settings for this are  Default ,  2 \u00a0and  Infinite .\n- \u201cDash Assist\u201d - When dashing, stops time while holding the dash button, allowing the player to precisely control the timing and direction of their dashes.\n- \u201cInvincibility\u201d - Makes Madeline invincible against all hazards. She will bounce on top of voids without dying to them; blocks that try to crush her will become non-solid; And, if she dashes into a wall through a Dream Block, she will bounce into the opposite direction.\nVanilla Entities\nVanilla entities are any entities which can be found in vanilla Celeste.  Below is a list of vanilla entities.\n\u201c Badeline \u00a0Chaser\u201d \u00a0- Clones of  Badeline \u00a0that chase Madeline in Chapter 2, Old Site. They will be  2 \u00a0seconds behind Madeline and will copy her moves exactly, killing her if touched.\n\u201cBooster\u201d \u00a0- (aka \u201cbubble\u201d) Large bubbles that, shortly after being entered, launch the player in any direction they choose. There are two types of boosters:\n- Green:  Introduced in Chapter 4, they quickly launch the player in a chosen direction before popping, covering a distance similar to that of a dash.\n- Red: \u00a0 Introduced in Chapter 5, they move in a chosen direction in a straight line indefinitely until they are popped by colliding with a solid or the player dashing out of them.\n\u201cCassette Bubble\u201d \u00a0- After collecting a cassette, a large bubble  envelops \u00a0Madeline and brings her back to the start of the room. These bubbles are also used in Chapter 9, Farewell when collecting the keys in the Power Source checkpoint, where it would be impossible to return without them. Additionally, cassette bubbles are often used for strawberries in custom maps. (not to be confused with \u201cBooster\u201d, which is nicknamed \u201cbubble\u201d)\n\u201cCore Block\u201d \u00a0- A block found in chapter 8, also known as Core. This block has two different abilities. It will launch the player if grabbed or landed on if it is in its lava state. However in its ice state it will crumble away.\n\u201cCore Switch\u201d \u00a0- A switch found in Chapter 8, that causes the level to turn from lava to ice state or vice versa. This has various effects, such as making  m adeline slide on the ground in ice mode, as well as entities such as core blocks and bumpers switching to a different variant.\n\u201cCrumble Block\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0Grey blocks found throughout the game, first in Chapter 1 that quickly \u201ccrumble\u201d after landing or climbing on them, causing them to become intangible. They quickly reform a short period after being broken, providing that no tiles are covering them.\n\u201cDream Block\u201d  - The starry black blocks from Chapter 2. If these are dashed into, Madeline will continuously move through the block in the direction she dashed until she exits the block or hits a wall, the latter of which kills her. Exiting a dream block returns Madeline\u2019s dash.\n\u201cDust Bunny\u201d  - The black and dark red creatures from Chapter 3, acting either as a static or moving obstacle.\n\u201cFeather\u201d \u00a0- A golden feather introduced in Chapter 6, Reflection. When collected, it allows Madeline to fly in any direction for 2 seconds. While not holding in any direction, she will move much more slowly. A feather will regenerate Madeline\u2019s dash, unless she dashes out of it early.\n\u201cFlag\u201d \u00a0- Respawn points denoted by the image of a flag, followed by a number. In the base game, they are used in Chapter 7, Summit, Sides A and B. They are also frequently used in mo d s. Flags typically  count down ; so the lower the number, the closer the player is to the end. Certain flags may be abbreviated as f#, for instance, Flag 2 as F2. (Not to be confused with the #F format, which indicates the number of frames in which an action can be completed. See \u2018Frame Perfect.\u2019)\n\u201cHeart Gate\u201d - \u00a0Large, blue walls of light with hearts on them, found on all sides of Chapter 8, Core, and halfway through Chapter 9, Farewell. They serve \u00a0The hearts indicate how many crystal hearts the player must collect to open the heart gate.\n\u201cJellyfish\u201d -  A large, parasol-shaped jellyfish introduced in Chapter 9, Farewell. When held, it will act like a parachute, greatly slowing Madeline\u2019s fall. Jellyfishes  disappear \u00a0when touching a seeker barrier (see below).\n\u201cKevin\u201d \u00a0- The moving blocks with angry faces introduced in Chapter 6, Reflection, are referred to as \u2018Kevins\u2019. They get this name from the fact that they got their voices from Kevin, a developer.\n\u201cKey\u201d \u00a0- Golden keys introduced in Chapter 3, Celestial Resort.. They are used to open locked doors and, therefore, are required to progress in a chapter. Once collected, the keys will follow Madeline around and will stay with her even if she dies.\n\u201cOshiro\u201d \u00a0- The owner of the Celestial Resort Hotel in Chapter 3 (Celestial Resort), who turns into the main boss of the level in Presidential Suite. He periodically dashes from the right side of the screen to attack Madeline. The player may jump on Oshiro\u2019s head when he is dashing, with mechanics similar to that of the snowball or seeker entities. \u00a0 Being near Oshiro when he is dashing causes the game to slow down and the visuals to briefly turn black and white.\n\"Refill\" \u00a0- Crystals that refill the player's dashes and stamina fully. The amount of dashes restored depends on the color and number of diamonds present. Green, singular crystals restore one dash, while pink, double crystals restore two. These can only be collected when the player lacks a dash or is flashing red due to having low stamina. Most of these will respawn after about two seconds when collected, but some will not respawn until dying or screen transitioning.\n\u201cSeeker\u201d \u00a0- The monsters from the ends of Chapter 5, Mirror Temple A-Side and B-Side are referred to as \u2018seekers\u2019. These can be bounced off of, activate touch switches, break certain blocks, and are blocked by shimmering white Seeker Barriers that the player can pass through.\n\u201cSeeker Barrier\u201d \u00a0- Transparent walls of light introduced in Chapter 5 which stop seekers from passing through them. They also cause any jellyfishes that touch them to  disappear .\n\u201cSpinners\u201d  - Balls of crystal spikes, often used as the main hazard in maps. The term \u2018spinner\u2019 originates from their name in the code, as they are called \u2018Static Crystal Spinners\u2019.\n- \u201cSpinner Juice\u201d \u00a0- A nickname for a background substance that automatically fills the gaps between spinners when they are close enough. The substance is purely visual and does not kill you.\n\u201cSwap Block\u201d \u00a0- Blocks with a red circle in the middle found in Chapter 5, Mirror Temple. These will quickly move to another position when the player dashes, and will slowly return afterwards. They can be used to quickly gain momentum.\n\u201cTheo Crystal\u201d - \u00a0A large crystal containing Theo introduced in Chapter 5. When carrying him, Madeline will be weighed down, slowing her down and preventing her from dashing and climbing. If a Theo crystal falls into a death pit, he dies and causes Madeline to die with him. Certain doors exist which only open while Madeline is carrying a Theo crystal.\n\u201cTouch Switch\u201d \u00a0-  Often called \u201ccoins\u201d are t riggers that when interacted with can open switch gates, which are blocks that move when all touch switches are triggered.\n\"Zip Mover\" \u00a0- Blocks on conveyor belts found in Chapter 1, Forsaken City. These quickly move to the end of the conveyor when the player touches them, and can be used for fast momentum gain. (aka \"traffic block\")\nVanilla Techniques and Game Mechanics [a] [b] [c]\nTechniques, or \u201ctech\u201d for short, are certain actions the player can perform to achieve something. Game mechanics are any mechanic that informs the way Madeline and the environment interact; since the two are inextricably linked, they are listed together. Below is a list of techniques and mechanics that exist  within the vanilla game. [d]\n\u201c5jump\u201d  - Grabbing the side of a block above spikes just above where she can hang onto the block will cause Madeline to be repositioned lower down. Doing another  climbjump \u00a0before this happens will allow Madeline to jump from slightly higher than she normally can, crossing a larger gap. Normally she can only cross a four tile long row of spikes, but with this technique, she can cross five, hence \u201c5jump.\u201d\n\" 6jump \" \u00a0- A dashless  cornerboost , done by approaching the top corner of a tile with walking speed, then  climbjumping \u00a0off of it for additional speed. With this, the player can cross a 6-tile gap of spikes.\n\u201c 7jump \u201d  - A  dashless \u00a0double  cornerboost , done the same way as a 6jump, but pressing a second jump button shortly after the first and beginning slightly lower on the wall to account for this.\n\"8jump\" \u00a0- A very difficult tech involv ing the same tech as a 7jump, but starting with +40 speed from a ground jump, and with a third  non-cornerboosting \u00a0 climbjump \u00a0added on. This  cornerboost \u00a0 will give +0 speed, but is required for gaining slightly more height. If starting an 8jump with more speed, the third  climbjump \u00a0may not be required. This mechanic is extremely precise, being subpixel dependent. (see also, \u2018subpixels\u2019.)\n\u201c9jump\u201d -  wallboost into dcb 4 frame perfect lmao wtf\u2026 this actually fucking exists [f]\n\u201c10jump\u201d \u00a0-\n\u201c11jump\u201d -\n\u201cArc Ultra\u201d  -\n\u201cArchie\u201d  - Entering a booster in a crouched state causes the position of the booster to shift upwards  slightly, as if Madeline is uncrouching within the bubble.  This has applications in speedrunning and hard clears. It\u2019s named after a little green parrot named Archie!  [g]\n\u201cBackboost\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cbboost\u201d) - When throwing a holdable, you gain a small speed boost in the opposite direction of the throw (8 0 speed ). In this technique, you must quickly turn around to throw the holdable behind you then turn back around. Spend as little time as possible moving in the direction of the throw to minimize speed loss and make use of the backboost.\n\u201cBino Clip\u201d \u00a0- Binoculars can be used to scroll the camera to the side and unload spinners. Ending the interaction does not cause the camera to return immediately, so this slight delay can be used to pass through unloaded spinners before they load.\n\u201cBino Control Storage\u201d \u00a0- In rare circumstances, for example skipping a cutscene while interacting with a bino, it is possible to cancel the dummy state that binoculars give you without canceling the interaction entirely. This results in being able to have control of Madeline while also controlling the camera using the binoculars. This is usually used in combination with spinner unloading, because spinners won\u2019t be loaded if they are outside of the camera.\n\u201cBino Interaction Storage\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cbino storage\u201d)- Interacting with binoculars for exactly one frame and jumping on the next frame tricks the game into thinking that Madeline is interacting with the binoculars when she is not. One of the consequences of this is that a dash through a screen transition gets canceled, which means that performing a grounded ultra through a screen transition allows the 1.2x speed boost to be retained past the end of the dash.\n\u201cBlock Boost'' \u00a0- (aka \u201cblockboost\u201d) - There is a brief  nine -frame window where after letting go of a moving block, such as a zip mover, where Madeline can  perform a wall jump off of the block and gain momentum . (Not to be confused with \u2018liftboost\u2019, a game mechanic that enables block boosts to be performed.)\n\u201cBoost Holdable Storage\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0 Releasing grab while holding a throwable when getting a boost from a fish or bumper causes a strange state to occur where Madeline acts for a short time as if she isn\u2019t holding a throwable, while visually she is. Madeline can dash in this state while seemingly holding the throwable (see \u201cThrowable Dash\u201d). If grabbed, Madeline does a pickup animation, and then the Madeline will be in the regular throwable grab state. If not grabbed, or Madeline does not dash, the throwable is thrown/dropped automatically after a short time after the boost. This tech was popularized by the strawberry room, \u201cExtra Ball\u201d in Pinball Purgatory, an infamous map from the strawberry jam collab.  (aka \u201cExtra ball tech\u201d, \u201ceb tech\u201d, \u201cFreeze Frame Ungrab\u201d, \u201cbumper ungrab\u201d)\n\u201cBubble Super/Hyper\u201d \u00a0- Dashing into a bubble (called a \u2018booster\u2019 in game files) from a grounded state allows you to input a super or hyper immediately as you enter the bubble and jump from the bubble as though it were solid ground.\n\u201cBubsdrop\u201d \u00a0- A bubsdrop is a technique used to immediately enter a downwards screen transition after entering a room from below, by doing a short jump as you enter the room to gain less height than the screen transition would give. This is notable in the chapter 5 B-side, as it allows the player to skip a portion of the chapter by resetting the player\u2019s respawn point.  This video \u00a0showcases an example of this phenomenon. (see also, \u2018 dreadcorner \u2019)\n\u201cBuffer\u201d \u00a0- A game mechanic present in many modern video games where if you input the controls to perform an action before your character is able, the game will read the input and perform the action as soon as it is able. In Celeste, for example, pressing the jump button shortly before coming in contact with the ground will still result in a jump. Most inputs can be buffered up to 5 frames, notable exceptions are buffering a pause out of a pause (6 frames) and grab/ slow fall \u00a0which can be buffered infinitely.\n\u201cBumper Boost\u201d \u00a0- Holding the direction away from a bumper while colliding with it will cause Madeline to be propelled away at a much higher speed and distance. Holding the direction towards the bumper will have the opposite effect.\n\u201cBumper Clip\u201d \u00a0-  After hitting a bumper, the player can dash towards the bumper and move through it, due to a lack of collision while the bumper is inactive. Performing this technique requires the player to initially contact the bumper at a precise angle. This tech is famously explored in the map \u2018Pinball Purgatory\u2019 from the Strawberry Jam Collab. (aka \u201cphase\u201d ,  \u201cbumper phase\u201d , \u201cblip\u201d )\n\u201cBunny Hop\u201d \u00a0- Performing short jumps in quick succession allows you to move faster than walking speed. Performing bunnyhops also allows the player to reduce loss of momentum. (aka \u201cbunnyhop\u201d or \u201cbhop\u201d)\n\u201cCassette Boost\u201d \u00a0- Jumping off of a cassette block within the first frame of it being active causes the jump to gain extra height.\n\u201cCassette Raise\u201d \u00a0- Remaining inside a cassette block while it activates and deactivates causes it to move upwards by two pixels. This can be repeated indefinitely to move a cassette block upwards vertically, provided you have the means to remain inside the cassette block for the required time period.\n\u201cCassette Boosted Feather Super\u201d \u00a0- This refers to a niche technique involving performing a jump using the momentum of exiting a feather while on an activating cassette block. Due to its specificity, it has very little application in gameplay. This tech is most often referred to humorously due to its convoluted abbreviation.  This video \u00a0showcases an example of this phenomenon.  \u00a0 (aka \u201ccassoosted fuper\u201d)\n\u201cCeiling Pop\u201d \u00a0- (aka \u201ccpop\u201d) When Madeline is at the bottom pixel of a wall, she can go under the wall and seemingly climbjump under the wall, hitting her head on the ceiling (hence why it\u2019s called a \u2018ceiling pop\u2019).  This technique is extremely precise, requiring frame-perfect timing and extremely precise positio ning down to less than a pixel.  (see also, \u2018frame perfect\u2019 and \u2018subpixels\u2019.) \u00a0 \u00a0 Cpops can also be performed off of spiked walls, requiring precision all the way down to a tenth of a pixel,  referred \u00a0to as \u201cspiked ceiling pops\u201d .\n\u201cCeiling Pop Cornerboost\u201d  - (aka \u201cpopcorn\u201d) A tech combining ceiling pops and corner boosts. This is achieved by performing a ceiling pop with enough horizontal speed to get a corner boost under the block. [h]\n\u201cCeiling Pop Cornerboost Wallboost\u201d - \u00a0(aka \u201cpopcornwob\u201d) \u00a0 A tech combining ceiling pops, corner boosts, and wallboosts. This is achieved by performing a ceiling pop cornerboost (see above), then switching directions to cancel horizontal speed with a wallboost. This can be used to jump under a block and grab onto the other side without dashing in highly specific situations.  [i]\n\u201cChained Ultra\u201d \u00a0- Performing several ultras in sequence will give Madeline an exponentially increasing speed boost. (aka \"Chultra\", \u201cChultras\u201d)\n\u201cClimb Boosting\u201d \u00a0-  This tech refers to gaining liftboost from a moving block that Madeline cannot grab. To do this, Madeline must do a wall jump from the block while holding grab. Holding grab allows Madeline to get the liftboost even when she cannot grab the block.  [verify]\n\u201cClimbhop\u201d  - Climbing onto the top of a platform causes Madeline to perform a small hop.\n\u201cClimbhop Cancel\u201d  -  Dashing during a climbhop on a moving object allows Madeline to retain the speed of the moving object into the dash, even if the dash is in a different direction to the block\u2019s movement . This has strange consequences, even including allowing the player to move through spikes under particular circumstances.  [j] \u201cClimbhop Cancel Ceiling Pop Cornerboost Wallboost Delayed Ultra\u201d -  (aka \u201cclobpopcornhob dultra\u201d)  \ud83d\udc80 what the fuck\n\u201cClimbhop Entanglement\u201d  - This niche technique allows the player to \u2018entangle\u2019 their momentum with a moving block without being in contact with that block. By canceling the animation Madeline does when climbing up to the top of a tile, which can be done (not exclusively) with a dash,  then by resetting Madeline\u2019s forced x by jumping off of other walls in intervals of 12 frames or less [k] , or hitting springs in intervals of 18 frames or less, Madeline\u2019s momentum will remain \u2018entangled\u2019 with the block.  This means that, as long as the block remains moving, its momentum will be applied to Madeline. If the block changes direction or stops moving, Madeline\u2019s momentum will also reflect this.  [l]\n\u201cClimbjump\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cclimb jump\u201d) - While holding a wall, jumping while holding the direction towards the wall or upwards will result in a climbjump. This will consume 27.5 units of stamina,  one quarter \u00a0of Madeline\u2019s maximum stamina.\n\u201cCoffee Jump\u201d \u00a0- A coffee jump is simply a corner jump performed off of a one tile overhang, starting from a wall. It is performed by pressing the jump button twice in rapid succession, more easily with two jump keys. It is called the coffee jump, as it is a required technique for the winged golden strawberry in the chapter 1 A-side, on the screen that has a caf\u00e9 in the background.\n\u201cCore Super\u201d / \u201cCore Hyper\u201d \u00a0- Performing a Super or Hyper dash during a brief window as a core block is destroyed allows Madeline to super or hyper dash with the added momentum of the core block.\n\u201c Cornerboost \u201d \u00a0(aka \u201c coost \u201d, \u201ccboost\u201d or \"cb\") -  Climbjumping \u00a0into the top corner of a tile with some momentum will give a small speed boost. The speed boost will only apply if Madeline inputs a jump prior to grabbing the wall. This is particularly useful as a means of  canceling \u00a0a dash and keeping the dash speed beyond the usual  duration \u00a0of the dash (like a Super Dash). Note that, although niche, a cornerboost can also be  performed off of the bottom corner of a wall if the wall is moving vertically upwards with high enough speed, as this means that the wall will be above Madeline during the jump portion of the cornerboost meaning that she will avoid colliding with it .\n\u201cCornerboost Wallboost\u201d \u00a0- A wallboost from a cornerboost. This entails performing a cornerboost with a neutral climbjump (without holding horizontally) and then holding away from the direction climb jumped. Notably, this can instantly remove high amounts of speed due to the properties of a wallboost.  (aka \u201ccobwob\u201d, \u201cwoosted coost\u201d, \u201ccornerboosted wallboost\u201d)\n\u201cCornerslip\u201d \u00a0-  Coming within 1 pixel vertically of a platform without landing on the platform  allows Madeline\u2019s dash to be refilled without resetting vertical speed. This is often (incorrectly) referred to as a \u2018jasig jump\u2019 as it often occurs when performing the speedrun strategy \u2018jasig\u2019.\n\u201cCorner Correction\u201d \u00a0- A leniency mechanic in which jumping or dashing into the corner of a  solid surface in a given direction causes Madeline to automatically move around the corner instead of getting stopped by it. For example, jumping or dashing upwards into a corner on a ceiling will cause Madeline to move around the corner as long as she is, at most, 4 pixels away from the corner and moving towards the ceiling, which makes techniques such as wallbouncing more lenient.\n\u201cCorner Jump\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201ccjump\u201d) - Jumping off of  the  corner of a block will result in a wall jump. . (Sometimes it is referred to as \u201c cump \u201d, though this abbreviation is often avoided due to sounding suggestive.)\n\u201cCorner kick\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cckick\u201d)- Jumping into the corner of a block from underneath, then jumping again once the block is crossed, will allow Madeline to wall jump off of the corner. ( Corner Jumps and Corner Kicks are not to be confused. )\n\u201cCoyote Time\u201d \u00a0- Coyote time refers to the game allowing certain actions to be performed after they should technically no longer be possible. Jumping a few frames after walking off of a ledge will still result in a jump, for instance.  Coyote time is responsible for making various other techniques possible, including dream hypers/supers and core supers/hypers. \u00a0Like buffering, coyote time is a feature of various other games; in Celeste the window for coyote time is five frames. The mechanic\u2019s name is a reference to Wile E. Coyote, a character from Looney Tunes.\n\u201cDash\u201d \u00a0- One of the basic actions the player can perform. By holding a direction and pressing Dash, the player can dash in one of eight directions. By default, Madeline can only do this once. Afterwards she must regain the dash by touching the ground, collecting a refill, interacting with an entity, or entering a screen transition. When Madeline has one dash, her hair is red; when she has no dashes, her hair is light blue, and when she has two dashes, her hair turns pink and floaty.\n\u201cDash Attack\u201d  - A leniency mechanic wherein there is  a 5 frame window [verify] \u00a0after a dash ends \u00a0in which dash-activated entities, such as dream blocks and kevin blocks, can still be activated. [m]\n\u201cDash Bounce\u201d \u00a0- Dashing within 2 frames of inputting a wallbounce gives you a slight vertical bump when the dash ends. This is because the game applies a constant vertical speed to Madeline for 17 frames when doing a wall bounce, whereas Madeline\u2019s dash lasts for 15 frames. (aka \u201cdashbounce\u201d, \u201cdounce\u201d, or sometimes \u201cshaboingboing\u201d.)\n\u201cDash Redirection\u201d -  When dashing, the game freezes for 3 frames. During this period, [n] \u00a0the player can change the direction of their dash. This is what allows crouch dashes to be performed manually, as when dashing dowards, Madeline crouches, and when redirecting a downwards dash into another direction, she stays crouched.\n\u201cDash Trigger\u201d \u00a0- Missing Descriptor; include information on Dash Trigger Skip (DTS) [o]\n\u201cDelayed Block Boost\u201d \u00a0- A block boost may still be performed if the player is no longer in contact with the block, instead wall jumping off of another surface within the nine-frame window of being in contact with the block. This phenomenon is rarely called a \u201cdelayed block boost\u201d, though sometimes it is just referred to as a block boost.  This video \u00a0showcases an example of this phenomenon.  (aka \u2018momentum carry\u2019) [p]\n\u201cDelayed Ultra\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cdultra\u201d) -  Canceling a diagonal down dash before the dash ends and before touching the floor gives Madeline the 1.2x speed boost from the ultra  the next time she contacts the floor , essentially storing the speed boost to be used later. Canceling the dash can be achieved in several ways, including  climbjumping \u00a0during the dash or entering a feather.\n\u201cDemo Dash\u201d  (aka \u201cdemo\u201d) - Crouching while dashing horizontally will preserve the crouched hitbox while dashing. This action can be mapped to a single input in the controls menu. This has a wide variety of implications, including allowing the player to squeeze through gaps they normally can\u2019t.  Demos cannot be performed if the player is in air and crouching and will instead cause the player to uncrouch immediately, which also means that a demo dash cannot be buffered out of another demo dash \u00a0like normal dashes can. \u00a0(aka \u201ccrouch dash\u201d)\n\u201cDemo Hyper\u201d -  Dashing diagonally downward, followed by a jump, will result in a hyper dash. However, the player can perform a hyper dash by demo dashing horizontally as well. This is called a \u2018demo hyper\u2019. Demo hypers have some additional utility compared to normal hypers; they can give more distance due to the dash extending slightly further, as well as allowing players to  perform the technique in midair \u00a0or on dream blocks, for instance. (see also, \u2018midair super\u2019).\n\u201cDeleting Madeline Safely\u201d  -  Missing Descriptor (??????)\n\u201cDouble  Cornerboost \u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cdcb\u201d) - Performing two  cornerboosts \u00a0on the same tile, often by using two jump buttons in quick succession. (not to be confused with  \u2018Depths Cornerboost\u2019 [speedrunning trick, needs entry] , which also uses the acronym \u2018dcb\u2019)\n\u201cDream Boost\u201d  (aka \u201cdroost\u201d) - When Madeline exits a dream block, the minuscule boost she gets from it is called a \u201cdream boost\u201d. This mechanic is most often referred to in the context of the niche \u2018splipped droost\u2019 technique. (see \u2018splipped droost\u2019) [q]\n\"Dream Double Jump\" \u00a0-  Pressing jump \u00a0just before exiting a dream block, and again in the coyote time  given from exiting a dream block will cause a jump that has more distance/height than a normal dream jump . This is because a jump adds 40 horizontal speed, so the second jump would both add another 40 speed on top of the first, as well as having slightly more height than a normal dream jump would. (aka \"ddj\")\n\u201cDream Grab\u201d \u00a0- While exiting a dream block from a side, hold the grab button and the opposite direction of movement to cling onto the edge of the dream block.\n\u201cDream Grab Hyper\u201d -  a player can perform a hyper out of a dream block within five frames of exiting the dream block, even if they perform a dream grab first. This is particularly useful with Theo (see \u2018theohyper\u2019).\n\u201cDream Hyper/Super\u201d \u00a0- Inputting a hyper/super during the five-frame coyote time window given after exiting a dream block will give the height and distance of a hyper/super dash, but will consume the player\u2019s dash. (see also, \u2018coyote time\u2019) Dream hypers cannot be performed if the player enters the dream block crouched or vertically. (aka \u201cdryper\u201d)\n\u201cDream Jump\u201d \u00a0- Press Jump while exiting the dream block to jump out of the dream block. This works in all directions. There are a total of 13 frames for this, 5 buffer frames, 3 freeze frames and then 5 coyote frames. (See also, \u2018Coyote Time\u2019.) You cannot Dream Jump if you  enter \u00a0the block vertically.\n\u201cDream Smuggle\u201d  - By dashing into a dream block and grabbing an object right before entering it, Madeline can carry held objects while dashing through Dream Blocks. Although this technique is technically vanilla, it has no practical use. It has more prevalence in custom Celeste maps. (aka \u201csmuggle\u201d, \u201cdream smuggle\u201d)\n\u201cExtended Super/Hyper\u201d \u00a0- Performing a super or hyper and waiting 10 frames before jumping will return Madeline\u2019s dash. \"Extended\" is sometimes shortened to \"ex\" or \"ext\".\n\u201cFailed Neutral\u201d \u00a0- A term used to refer to jumping away from a wall and immediately steering back towards it without performing a neutral, which loses a small amount of height on the wall. This is generally only used to set up a consistent subpixel positioning for other techniques, such as demos.\n\u201cFast Bubble\u201d \u00a0- Pressing Dash while in a bubble will cause the bubble to move in a direction sooner than usual. (aka \u201cfastbubble\u201d, or \"fubble\")\n\u201cFast Fall\u201d  - While falling, holding down will  make you fall much faster . \u00a0Madeline\u2019s sprite appears to narrow while fastfalling . [r]\n\u201cFeather Bounce\u201d  - This refers to when a player bounces off of a wall to change directions quickly, usually doing a 180 degree turn.\n\u201cFeather Clip\u201d \u00a0-  Using a feather against the top of a jump-through platform will allow Madeline to clip through the platform.  You must be holding down against the jump through when the feather expires.  [s]\n\u201cFeather Super\u201d  - Jumping along a solid surface while in the feather state will result in a longer, faster jump akin to a Super Dash. (see also \u2018Super Dash\u2019) (aka \u201cfuper\u201d, more often used in \u2018cassoosted fuper\u2019).\n\u201c Forced x \u201d \u00a0- This game mechanic temporarily forces a player to move in a specific direction for a certain number of frames. For example, a player is locked into moving right for 12 frames after performing a rightward wall jump.\n\u201cFrame Perfect\u201d  - These are a category of maneuvers that can only be performed on one single frame. Frames are the smallest increment of time in a video game. Celeste runs at 60 Frames per second, so each frame is one sixtieth of a second. The format for abbreviating these maneuvers is the number of frames in which a maneuver can be executed, followed by F. So for one frame maneuvers, the abbreviation is 1F. (Not to be confused with F#, which indicates a flag or checkpoint. See \u2018Flag.\u2019 Also not to be confused with  \u20182f\u2019, an April Fools map by Ellis Vesper which requires its own section under custom maps.) [t]\n\u201cFreeze Frame\u201d  - While interacting with certain mechanics or performing certain actions, such as bubbles or bumpers, t he game will briefly stop . (aka \u201cFF\u201d.)\n\u201cGrabless  Dream Hyper\u201d  (aka Mickey Mouse?)  Missing Descriptor\n\u201c Grounded Ultra\u201c \u00a0- A down diagonal dash that collides with the ground before the dash ends. These can be chained by wavedashing out of the first down diagonal dash, then quickly dashing in the same direction again. Colliding with the ground out of the down diagonal dash will still provide a 1.2x speed boost, but the speed boost will not persist after the dash ends. This is the fastest method of travel across flat ground. (aka \"Gultra\",  \u201cGultras\u201d )\n\u201cGrounded Wallboost\u201d \u00a0- A niche technique involving performing a wallbo st shortly before \u00a0being grounded . This is done by grabbing a wall at the  highest point [u] , doing a short hop \u00a0neutral climbjump, holding towards the wall, and then wallboosting, usually followed by a coyote jump off the ground. Often, a cornerslip is performed after the wallboost to get the coyote jump from lower down.  (aka \u201cgwoost\u201d.)\n\u201cHalf Stamina Climb\u201d \u00a0- A technique done by doing neutral climb jump, followed by a wallboost and  the \u00a0a climbjump up to 2 frames after the wallb ost (sometimes must be 1f after due to subpixels). This results in a jump from the wall with less speed, since the climb jump acts as a reverse cornerboost, reducing speed by 40. Only the second of the two climbjumps uses up stamina (since the wallboost refunds the first climbjump\u2019s usage), hence the name.  (More detail on where an nrcb is used may or may not be useful) [v]\n\u201cHeart Ultra\u201d \u00a0- Dashing down diagonally at the exact moment Madeline bounces off a crystal heart allows her to collect it while maintaining the momentum of the bounce through the down diagonal dash. \u00a0By spending Madeline\u2019s dash before attempting to perform this technique, making use of buffering, this technique can be performed more leniently. This technique is usually only performed for flavor, but is sometimes useful. This tech can also be used to collect a heart, then cancel the  heart collect by \u00a0entering a screen transition. (aka \u201chultra\u201d)\n\u201cHoldable Climbjump\u201d  - Repeatedly neutral dropping a holdable object,  climbjumping \u00a0up the wall and picking up the object allows Madeline to scale a wall while still having the object. (aka \u201ctheo climb\u201d, \u201cjelly climb\u201d)\n\u201cHoldable Dash\u201d  - Dashing while in a holdable storage state . This allows madeline to dash after a boost while seemingly holding a holdable, by releasing grab when getting the boost. (see \u2018Boost Holdable Storage\u2019. Note that this tech may also be called  extra ball tech.)\n\u201cHoldable Lift\u201d -  Throwing a held object at a wall, then dashing up into the object while holding Grab as it rebounds off of the wall, will allow the player to gain some height with a held object. It is most easily and effectively performed with jellyfish, but can be performed with heavy objects as well. (not to be confused with \u2018jellyvator\u2019, \u2018theovator\u2019, \u2018jelly regrab\u2019, or \u2018jelly ladder\u2019.) [w]\n\u201cHyper Bunny Hop\u201d  - Performed by following up a hyper dash with a tiny jump, followed by a full jump, this technique allows Madeline to gain significantly more height and momentum than a hyper dash. (aka \u201chyper bunnyhop\u201d, \u201chyper bhop\u201d, or less commonly, \u201chbhop\u201d.)\n\u201cHyper Dash\u201d \u00a0- Following a down-diagonal dash on the ground with a Jump will result in a high-speed, low-height jump. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to performing a dash. (aka \u201chyper\u201d)\n\u201cInstant Hyper\u201d  - This tech refers to performing a hyper  with little delay between the dash and the jump.\n\u201cInstant Super\u201d  - This tech refers to performing a super  with little delay between the dash and the jump.\n\u201cJelly Bump\u201d \u00a0- Holding jump when grabbing a jellyfish at speed will cause the jellyfish to boost upwards, even when dashing downright or down into the jellyfish.  [x]\n\u201cJelly Juggle\u201d  - This does not refer to a particular technique, but when the player has multiple jellyfish around them and switches between them, it is called \u2018juggling\u2019.  [y]\n\u201cJelly Ladder\u201d  -  Having upwards momentum while repeatedly grabbing and neutral dropping two jellyfish allows Madeline to infinitely gain height by exploiting the upward boost from grabbing a jellyfish. Slowfalling makes this tech  more lenient to perform.\n\u201cJelly Neutrals\u201d  - Repeatedly neutral dropping a jelly, neutral jumping off the wall and picking up the jelly allows Madeline to ascend a wall while retaining a jelly and not using stamina (see \u2018Neutral jumps\u2019). Note that you can also do this by gliding back to the wall using the jelly, but that requires a lot more horizontal space than is often available. This is not to be confused with holdable  climbjumping .\n\u201cJelly Regrab\u201d \u00a0- Throwing a Jellyfish while in midair, then immediately diagonal dashing back into it, will allow you to gain some extra height and distance from the jellyfish. Regrabbing a jellyfish can be performed horizontally, as well, if starting from a neutral drop. If done vertically, it is instead called \u2018jellyvator\u2019. Regrabs can also be performed on heavier objects, such as Theo\u2019s crystal, but this is much more difficult and sometimes requires the player to dash more than once to catch the object.\n\u201cJellyvator\u201d \u00a0- Neutral dropping from a jellyfish then dashing up into the jellyfish while holding Grab allows the player to gain some height while holding the jellyfish. This technique is similar to \u2018holdable lift\u2019, but does not require a nearby wall to perform the technique. When done with a heavier object, such as Theo\u2019s crystal, it is called \u201ctheovator\u201d. (not to be confused with \u2018jelly regrab\u2019 or \u2018holdable lift\u2019.)\n\u201cKermit Dash\u201d  - \u00a0 Missing Descriptor\n\u201cKoral \u00a0Skip \u201d  -  When Madeline is pushed against the border of a screen by certain entities, including Kevins or zip movers, Madeline will \u2018teleport\u2019 to the other side of the entity. This is called Koral Skip, \u00a0 I think, for some reason. Need verification . [z]\n\u201cLaunch Dash Redirect\u201d -  Missing Descriptor\n\u201cLava Neutral\u201d - \u00a0 The player can neutral off of lava and ice with frame perfect timing. [aa]\n\u201cLava Wall Jump\u201d \u00a0-  The player can also walljump off of lava with frame perfect timing.\n\u201cLiftboost\u201d  - This is a game mechanic that applies the speed of a moving block onto Madeline. There is a  nine -frame window where Madeline can gain a boost in momentum from a moving block, even after she is no longer touching the block or if the block stops moving. (Not to be confused with \u2018block boost\u2019, a technique that utilizes the mechanic liftboost.)\n\u201cLow Speed Ultra\u201d \u00a0-  When you start a down diagonal dash toward the ground, too high to initiate a wavedash, then jump with the slight extra speed of that dash. This is \u00a0normally an ultra, but if performed with no initial speed boost, this ultra will result in a minimal gain in speed, which cannot be used to chain speed boosts. (see the buffering section in  \u2018 Ultras and You \u2019 ).  (These may also be referred to as a  \u201c Failed Wavedash\u201d . This term is rarely used, due to its misleading or confusing name, given that there are several ways to \"fail\" a wavedash. \u00a0(aka \u201cfyper\u201d, \u201cfailed hyper\u201d or \u201ccarwash\u201d) [ab]\n\u201cMidair Hyper\u201d \u00a0- Starting in midair, demo dashing while level with some ground and jumping when reaching that ground will have Madeline perform a hyper dash. To avoid confusing these with wavedashes, they are often called \u201cmidair demo hypers\u201d or simply \u201cdemo hypers\u201d. (see also \u2018demo hyper\u2019, and \u2018wavedash\u2019.)\n\u201cMidair Super\u201d  - Starting in midair, dashing while level with some ground and jumping when reaching that ground will have Madeline perform a super dash.\n\u201cMoonboost\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0 Performing a super dash or demo hyper into the top three pixels of a moon block will push the moon block while simultaneously correcting the player to be on top of the moon block due to corner correction, resulting in a speed boost not possible on normal terrain. (See also, \u2018moon block\u2019 and \u2018corner correction\u2019.) (aka \u201cmoost\u201d)\n\u201cMultiboost\u201d \u00a0-  A technique where multiple boosts are gained from a block in quick succession, possible because of the properties of liftboost. There are many different ways to gain multiple block boosts, but the most common and easiest is to jump from a moving block and then immediately dash down-diagonally. (aka \u201cdbb\u201d for \u2018double block boost\u2019.)\n\u201cNeutral Drop\u201d \u00a0- Holding Down and letting go of Grab while holding an object will cause Madeline to drop whatever she is holding in place instead of flinging it in the direction she is facing.\n\u201cNeutral Jump\u201d \u00a0- Jumping from a wall while holding no direction  will not consume any stamina , and will push Madeline a very short distance from the wall. This is useful, as you can then press back towards the direction of the wall to perform another neutral jump. This allows you to scale walls without grabbing the wall or consuming stamina. (aka \u201cneutrals\u201d, \u201cneutral climb\u201d, or \u201cneutral wall jump\u201d.)\n\u201cNeutral Reverse Cornerboost\u201d \u00a0- A reverse cornerboost, but with a neutral climbjump (you release horizontal inputs before  climbjumping ) This means that you do not lose the 40 speed you usually do,  so usually are more efficient for speed if followed by another dash. However, since the climbjump is neutral, there is the possibility of wallbosting afterwards, which sets your speed to a constant. To avoid this, you should dash before holding downleft, and then change to holding downleft in freeze frames (to redirect the dash)  (aka \u201cnrcb\u201d)\n\"Overclocking\" \u00a0- This refers to any tech that results in Madeline receiving more stamina than her normal maximum using a wallboost. Most commonly this \u00a0is done by  performing a wallboost while in contact with the ground.  Because the player is starting from the ground, stamina is not consumed by the  action , however, the stamina refund is still applied, giving Madeline extra stamina. This is just one example; this tech can be performed by resetting Madeline\u2019s stamina in any way in the middle of a wallboost.  (see also \u201cwallboost\u201d.) (Not to be confused with \u201cgrounded wallbost\u201d)\n\u201cOverhangs\u201d  -  A \u00a0dashless tech which is performed when Madeline jumps from one wall and jumps onto the same wall but bulged by a few tiles. The easiest overhangs are 1-3 tile overhangs, which are very lenient and quite easy to pull off. However, 4tiles, 5tiles, and 6tiles require much more precise and difficult moves to pull off.. There are also a couple of niche overhangs, including 3x2 which is when Madeline has to jump 3 tiles horizontally and 2 tiles vertically, and a 2x1 which is 2 tiles horizontally and 1 tile vertically.\n\u201cPerfect Cornerjump\u201d  (aka \u201cpcj\u201d, sometimes referred to jokingly as \u201c penis cock jump \u201d) \u00a0 Missing Descriptor [ac] [ad] [ae] [af]\n\u201cPuffer Boost\u201d \u00a0- Similar to \u2018Bumper Boost\u2019, this technique involves holding the direction away from a pufferfish as it explodes to gain more speed and distance. Holding the direction towards the pufferfish has the opposite effect. (aka \u201cFish Boost\u201d, \u201cFoost\u201d)\n\"Reform Tech\" \u00a0-  Blocks that break and respawn (Move Blocks, Core Blocks etc.) respawn initially without their spikes and the spikes load in shortly after. This gives a brief window of time to land on the top of the block.\n\u201cRetention Tech\u201d \u00a0- Entering a booster in \u00a0a particular way (specific details needed) \u00a0puts Madeline in a strange state where the game thinks she\u2019s inside the bubble, while Madeline is still moving outside of the bubble. This allows the player to fire the bubble, immediately snapping Madeline back inside of the bubble.  [ag]\n\"Reverse Cornerboost\" \u00a0- \u00a0P erforming an up-diagonal dash \u00a0from underneath a bottom corner of a wall with high speed, and then turning around and  climbjumping \u00a0off of the wall cancels the dash and allows the dash momentum to be retained into the  climbjump .\n\u201cReverse Super\u201d, \u201cReverse Hyper\u201d or \u201cReverse Wavedash\u201d \u00a0- While performing a super, hyper, or wavedash, jumping in the opposite horizontal direction to the dash causes the resulting speed to be given in the opposite direction to normal. As with a regular super/hyper/wavedash, if Madeline is in contact with the floor on or after the 10th frame of the dash, she will retain her dash, which is called 'extending'. This technique is typically used to extend a super/hyper/wavedash off a small platform against a wall, where it would normally not be possible to. \u00a0Reverse is sometimes shortened to \u2018rev\u2019.\n\u201cRoboboost\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0An extremely complicated TAS-only speedrun technique.  Needs elaboration . [ah] [ai] [aj] [ak] [al]\n\u201cScreen Transition Cassette Offset\u201d  - Using a screen transition as a cassette block activates causes all cassette blocks of that color in the new screen to be one pixel higher, and all cassette blocks of the previous color to be one pixel lower .  This video  showcases an example of this phenomenon.\n\u201cSeeker Boost\u201d \u00a0- Similarly to a bumper boost or puffer boost, holding the direction away from a seeker at the moment it respawns will propel Madeline away from the seeker at a much higher speed and distance. Due to the difficulty in execution, this technique is seldom used. (See also, \u2018bumper boost\u2019)\n\u201cShoryuken\u201d -  [am]\n\"Slow Fall\" \u00a0-  While holding the jump button as Madeline is in a jump arc, Madeline\u2019s descent will be slightly slowed down until she reaches maximum falling velocity. Unlike Fast Falling, this technique is very difficult to discern from regular falling, as the difference is so small and there is no physical change in Madeline\u2019s sprite.  [Verify] [an] [ao]\n\u201cSnake Ultra\u201d  - This refers to an ultra that can be performed with superdash by having the player dash downright, shift down, then downright, then right, or vice versa. This gives the player high speed and results in an S-shaped dash pattern (aka \u201csnultra\u201d. Some people mistakenly believe that this tech is called a \u201csnail ultra\u201d.)\n\u201cSpike d \u00a0Climb\u201d \u00a0- I f Madeline maintains low speed away from a spiked wall, she can remain within a 2 pixel distance away from it, and therefore still able to jump off the wall (due to wall jump leniency) without the dying to the spikes since she has speed moving in the direction that they face. Spike climbs in which Madeline moves a significant distance up the wall are sometimes TAS-only. An example of a spike climb can be found  here , though not all spike climbs are as long as this.  (aka \u201cspike climb\u201d, \u201csplimb\u201d)\n\u201cSpike Clip\u201d \u00a0 If Madeline is moving downwards at a high enough  velocity [ap] \u00a0towards spikes with no tile beneath them, Madeline may move through the spike without dying. The way that she does this is by having the bottom pixel of her hurtbox go from above the spike hitbox to below it in 1 frame, essentially frame skipping the spike. The reason this happens is because the developers made it so that the bottom pixel is the only pixel that needs to be touching the spike in order for madeline to get killed.  (aka \u201cspikeclip\u201d, this tech is sometimes also called \u201cspikefall\u201d or \u201cspike fall\u201d, but this term can also refer to a setup to perform a spike clip.)\n\u201cSpike Clipped Dream Boost\u201d  - When there are spikes surrounding a dream block and Madeline does a perfect dash towards a corner, it\u2019s possible for Madeline to seemingly clip through the spikes and get the boost from the dream block despite there being no area for Madeline to touch the dream block. Due to its precision and limited application, it is rarely used in custom maps. This tech is most often referred to as a joke. (aka \u201cSplipped Droost\u201d.)\n\u201cSpike Jump\u201d \u00a0- When an external object, such as wind or zip movers, pushes Madeline into spikes or pushes spikes into Madeline while Madeline has speed away from the spikes, there is a brief window of time where she can jump off the wall behind the spikes due to the order in which Celeste handles operations. (Not to be confused with Corner Jumps, Corner Kicks or 5 /6 Jumps)\n\u201cSpiked Cornerboost\u201d  - A spiked cornerboost is a precise cornerboost on a spike-covered tile performed by positioning Madeline just above the spike hitbox, but low enough to perform a wall jump from the tile.\n\u201cSpiked Wallbounce\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0Madeline can perform a wallbounce off of a spiked tile if the jump is performed during the three frames of  leniency \u00a0after the 15 normal frames of dash (see also, \u2018dash attack\u2019) and if the player holds in the same direction that the spikes are facing.  [aq] [ar]\n\u201cSpinner Stun\u201d \u00a0- This is a difficult technique that exploits the system. By unpausing and pausing on consecutive frames, the player can prevent the spinners\u2019 hitboxes from loading, allowing Madeline to pass through them. By beginning the process of loading in a group of spinners (each screen has three spinner groups) while Madeline is near enough to them to load, and pausing constantly, allowing the game to only run unpaused for one or two frames at a time, the spinners will remain unloaded. (aka \u201cstun\u201d)\n\u201cSpinner Unload\u201d \u00a0- Spinner Unloads refer to a variety of tech that involve unloading the spinners on a screen in some way. There are many ways to do this. The most common way is to move so that the spinners are no longer on screen. If the player can somehow move offscreen, the spinners will be unloaded and Madeline can safely move through them. This can be achieved by having high enough speed that the spinners don\u2019t have enough time to load when they come onscreen or that Madeline herself is offscreen. This can also be achieved with a glitch that involves waiting  119 hours (need exact amount of time) \u00a0for two thirds of the spinners in a room to unload.  [as]\n\"Spring Cancel\" \u00a0- Dashing quickly after hitting a spring cancels the momentum from the spring. (aka \"sprancel\")\n\u201cSquish Refill\u201d  -  Missing Descriptor\n\u201cStamina\u201d \u00a0- Stamina is a  stat istic which depletes when Madeline either climbs up a wall, hangs  onto \u00a0a wall or performs a climbjump. Madeline\u2019s maximum stamina is 110 units. When she runs out of stamina, she will no longer be able to grab walls. Madeline\u2019s sprite will begin to flash red when she has below 20 units of stamina, at which point she will be able to continue holding a wall until she runs out of stamina but cannot grab another wall. She may still climbjump. Madeline will instantly regain stamina by touching the ground, interacting with an entity, collecting a refill, or entering a screen transition. Note that climbing down a wall does not deplete stamina.\n\u201cStamina Canceling\u201d \u00a0- When climbing a wall, holding up and tapping grab repeatedly instead of simply holding up and grab. When done correctly, this uses less stamina than climbing the wall normally.\n\u201cSubpixels\u201d \u00a0- Madeline's position, as well as some \u00a0other entities such as the Theo Crystal and Seekers, are saved as a Float (decimal) value. [au] \u00a0This means that despite their positions only being shown as occupying a certain set of pixels, their position is actually significantly more precise than that. This subpixel position can be manipulated by performing certain actions, such as dashing into a wall, landing on the ground, or  climbjumping \u00a0into a ceiling. Occasionally, when needing to fall into a pixel perfect gap for example, Madeline's subpixel position may sometimes prevent her from getting to the needed pixel by just holding in that direction, which is due to movement speed being a decimal number of pixels per frame.\n\u201cSuperdash\u201d  - A  mechanic  that appears in the  \u2018variants\u2019 \u00a0menu wherein Madeline is given a longer dash which can be course-corrected. Some custom maps can have this mechanic set by default for a unique challenge. (Not to be confused with \u2018Super Dash\u2019.)\n\u201cSuper Dash\u201d \u00a0(usually just \u201csuper\u201d) - Following a horizontal Dash on the ground with a Jump will allow Madeline to perform a longer and faster jump with the same height as a normal jump. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to performing a dash. (Not to be confused with \u2018Superdash\u2019.)\n\u201cSuperwave\u201d \u00a0- An extended super dash quickly followed by a reverse wavedash. Usually performed on crumble platforms and pink clouds.\n\u201cTheo Stall\u201d  -\n\u201cThrowable Dream Hyper\u201d \u00a0- A dream hyper done while holding a throwable. To perform this tech, you must perform a dream grab and then a dream hyper in quick succession after leaving a dream block. If you do not dream grab, the throwable is dropped/thrown upon leaving the dream block. (aka \u201ctheo dryper\u201d, \u201ctheo dream hyper\u201d)\n\u201cUltra\u201d \u00a0- Colliding with the ground from a down diagonal dash will give Madeline a 1.2x speed boost, and, if this collision happens after the dash ends, allow preservation of that speed. A jump is often used after this to preserve speed and gain more distance. For further detail, see the  Ultras and You \u00a0doc. This is sometimes called an \"Ultra Dash\", but that term is inaccurate, as there are several parts to an ultra apart from the dash. (aka \u201cUltras\u201d.)\n(That said, because of how ultras are introduced and nuance with getting the 1.2x speed multiplier may lead to people having inconsistent definitions of ultras and related terms.)\n\u201cUndemo\u201d  - a niche tech allowing the first frame of a down or down diagonal dash to be done without crouch. It is performed by starting a regular dash that is not down or down diagonal and then redirecting to down or down diagonal (the inverse of a manual demo).\n\u201c Wallboost\u201d \u00a0 - Doing a neutral  climbjump \u00a0then holding away from the wall within 11 frames will refund the stamina consumed by the move and instantly sets speed to 130 in the direction opposite of the wall. (aka \u201cwoost\u201d) (not to be confused with \u201cwallbounce.\u201d)\n\u201cWallbounce\u201d \u00a0- Dashing up and pressing Jump near a wall allows you to jump very high off of the wall. This technique is introduced in chapter 7B in vanilla Celeste. (aka \"wounce\" or \u201cwbounce\u201d, not to be confused with \u201cwallboost\u201d.)\n\u201cWall Jump\u201d \u00a0- If Madeline is right next to a wall, she can do a wall jump away from the wall, or in the neutral direction. Doing this in the neutral direction is called a \u2018neutral jump\u2019.  If Madeline jumps in the direction towards the wall while holding the wall, she will consume some stamina and jump in the direction towards the wall , which is called a \u2018 climbjump \u2019. If she is not holding the wall but attempts any wall jump other than a neutral jump, she will jump away from the wall instead. This is often the result of running out of stamina. (see also, \u2018neutral jump\u2019 and \u2018climb jump\u2019.)\n\u201cWater Boost\u201d -  When near the top  of a pool of water, Madeline can jump and if moving in a direction her jump grants the normal +40 speed boost. This can be performed every frame until Madeline is out of the water allowing the ability to get 200+ speed then any prior speed entering the water.  Although this technique is not TAS-only, TAS bots can perform this technique more  proficiently \u00a0than human players.\n\u201cWavedash\u201d \u00a0- Starting in midair, dashing towards the ground and jumping just before hitting the ground will give Madeline her dash back and propel her forward, similarly to an extended hyper. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to a dash. This technique is introduced and used extensively in Farewell.\n\u201cWrap Hyper\u201d \u00a0- This refers to when the player performs a dream hyper out of a dream block that they entered while crouched by performing a dream grab \u00a0to uncrouch \u00a0then inputting a hyper during coyote frames. It is very similar to performing a standard dream grab hyper, without theo, and done to uncrouch. It does not work diagonally. It is called this because Bred was eating a wrap when she decided to name it. Yup.\n\u201cYump\u201d \u00a0-  Missing Descriptor\nCustom Maps [av]\nCustom maps are maps created by the Celeste community to be played and enjoyed. Below is a list of some of the most historically important and highly regarded custom Celeste maps that exist, but it must be noted that this list is incomplete due to the sheer increasing number of existing custom Celeste maps.  We can add a resource to find more Celeste maps here too; I\u2019m thinking gamebanana or one of the more reputable map lists that exists.\n\u201cStrawberry Jam Collab\u201d \u00a0 - a large mod released in 2023, currently the largest Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSJ2023\u201d, \u201cSJ2021\u201d, \u201cStrawberry Jam\u201d, or \"SJ\".)  Below is a list of maps from Strawberry Jam, arranged in roughly ascending difficulty:\nSJ Beginner Lobby\n\u201cForest Path\u201d  - a green beginner map which takes place in a dark forest. The map utilizes dream refills, which allow you to dash through normal blocks as if they were a dream block. This is the easiest map in strawberry jam, and is a likely first map in strawberry jam.\n\u201cAzure Caverns\u201d  - a green beginner map taking place in a lush cave filled with boiling hot water. This map utilizes traffic blocks that only activate upon dashing into it, similar to a Kevin block.\n\u201cLoopy Lagoon\u201d  - a green beginner map which takes place in an ocean of milk.  The map is built around the mechanic of the giant cereal flakes, which resemble square Froot Loops. These cereal flakes have unique properties which bounce Madeline depending on how she interacts with them.\n\u201cCollapsing Skyline\u201d  - a green beginner map which takes place in a collapsing and ruined city filled with skyscrapers. This map utilizes dash blocks from mirror temple and falling blocks  to create a simple but uneasy platforming challenge.\n\u201cSeeing is Believing\u201d  - a green beginner map which is famous for its unique gameplay. This map features extremely easy gameplay, however you must do it without seeing. The intended way to play is to play blindfolded as a friend guides you through the map. However, most people do not have friends, so this map includes an alternative route where the room is completely darkened, with  Badeline \u00a0guiding the player through instead.\n\u201cIf my \u2018driveway\u2019 almost did you in\u2026\u201d  - a yellow beginner map which takes place in the same area as the prologue in vanilla celeste. The map is a reference to the prologue, where Madeline walks under a falling block. When she tells granny this, she laughs at Madeline and says, \u201cif my \u2018driveway\u2019 almost did you in, the Mountain might be a bit much for you,\u201d hence the name of the map. This entity, used only for this interaction in the vanilla game, is explored more thoroughly by this map. (aka \u201cdriveway\u201d)\n\u201cCassette Cliffs\u201d  - a yellow beginner map that takes place at the top of a giant rainforest. This map uses cassette blocks, cassette traffic blocks, and other types of cassette blocks there are, hence why it\u2019s called \u201ccassette cliffs\u201d. (aka \u201cccliffs\u201d)\n\u201cOver the City\u201d  - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a city at night. This somewhat lengthy and winding map disables Madeline\u2019s dash so it may focus solely on the jump crystal mechanic. (aka \u201cotc\u201d)\n\u201cTroposphere\u201d  - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a dream set above the mountain. This map is a somewhat simple platforming puzzle focusing on  Badeline \u00a0boosts and dream blocks.\n\u201cPotential for Anything\u201d \u00a0A yellow beginner map which utilizes gravity inversion mechanics. This map is a reference to the video game VVVVVV.\n\u201cMidnight  Spire\u201d \u00a0 - A yellow beginner map that takes place in a blue tower. The background implies that the map also takes place in a mountainous region with a giant lake in the center. This map\u2019s platforming is somewhat tight and restrictive, but fairly easy.\n\u201cpaint\u201d  - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a colorful and lively village. This map places emphasis on its story, as Madeline struggles with a work of art that she believes is not good enough and struggles to make it perfect; meanwhile,  Badeline \u00a0attempts to act as a voice of reason and urges her to take better care of herself. The map\u2019s platforming relies on more traditional game mechanics of moving platforms and dodging projectiles, set in time with the map\u2019s music. Due to the map\u2019s high-effort presentation, it is widely regarded to be the most iconic map in all of Strawberry Jam.\n\u201cRose Garden\u201d  - A yellow beginner map which takes heavy inspiration from Super Mario Galaxy, particularly the gusty garden galaxy. The map\u2019s main mechanic, a holdable rose which acts as a parachute, giving Madeline an upwards boost whenever she presses the dash button, is also an idea borrowed from Super Mario Galaxy.\n\u201cTreehive\u201d  - A yellow beginner map themed around a large beehive inside of a tree. The map\u2019s main mechanic is a particular variant of dream blocks, sometimes refered to as \u201choney blocks\u201d, which allow Madeline to reflect off of walls while inside, instead of dying when colliding with a wall.\n\u201cThe Squeeze\u201d  - a yellow beginner map taking place in a dismal city. The map challenges the player to use the level geometry to line  Madeline \u00a0up to fall into several  tight \u00a0gaps.\n\u201cSoap\u201d  - A red beginner map that takes place in a blue, bubbly environment. The main mechanics of this map are blue variants of entities found in the vanilla game, such as bubbles and springs, which, in their blue form, do not replenish Madeline\u2019s dash. This encourages the player to think twice about when and where to use their limited dashes.\n\u201cSwitchtube Vista\u201d  - A red beginner map that takes place in a purple, retro city. Its main mechanics are pipes which function similarly to warp pipes from the Super Mario franchise, and switch blocks which toggle certain portions of the level between being on and off. The map is highly evocative of retro games from the NES era, as its mechanics, presentation, and music all appear to draw inspiration from retro Nintendo games.\n\u201cA Gift From the Stars\u201d  - a red beginner puzzle map taking place in a forest at a UFO crash site. This map explores time-stopping mechanics to create infamously challenging puzzles. (aka \u201cagfts\u201d)\n\u201cStrawberry Orchard\u201d  - A red beginner map that takes place on a ranch, as Madeline cartoonishly endeavors to steal a jar of the ranch\u2019s famous strawberry jam. This map primarily utilizes pipes, as well as a heavy throwable jar of jam that the player must navigate to the end of each screen. This map is considered to have the most challenging platforming of the beginner lobby. (aka \u201corchard\u201d)\n\u201c Dropzle \u201d  - a red beginner puzzle map in which the player must use their finite number of dashes to align a series of Kevins in such a way that allows her to drop through a pixel perfect gap, hence \u2018 dropzle \u2019. Although it is possible, albeit challenging for most, to jump straight through the gap, it is discouraged by the map creator to do so. (Sometimes the term \u201cdropzle\u201d is also used to refer to pixel perfect gaps, in reference to this map.)\n\u201cCoresaken City\u201d  - a red beginner map combining decoration and mechanics of Chapter 1, Forsaken City, and Chapter 8, Core.\n\u201cBlueberry Bay\u201d  - the final challenge of the beginner lobby, Blueberry Bay is a beach-themed heartside with one flag dedicated to each of the maps in the beginner lobby.\nSJ Intermediate Lobby\n\u201cSleeping Under Stars\u201d -  a green intermediate map similar to Farewell in design but utilizes low gravity throughout the map.\n\u201cFrosted Fragments\u201d -  a green intermediate map that takes place in a frigid cave. It\u2019s main mechanics are blocks that the player can push to get further through the level or to obtain double dash refills and green boosters.\n\u201cFifth Dimension\u201d -  a green intermediate map that is defaulted to two dashes, makes use of boosters that don\u2019t refill the player\u2019s dash, and uses wallbounces as its primary technique.\n\u201cLow-G Botany\u201d -  missing description\n\u201cSpring Collab 2020\u201d \u00a0 - a large mod released in 2020. Prior to Strawberry Jam Collab, this was the largest and most well known Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSC2020\u201d, \u201cSpring Collab\u201d, or \u201cSC\u201d.)\nKeep in mind that standards for difficulty have increased since the map\u2019s release. A map from Spring Collab listed under Grandmaster difficulty may nowadays be considered merely Expert difficulty, for instance. \u00a0Below is a list of maps from Spring Collab, arranged in roughly ascending difficulty:\nSC2020  Beginner Lobby\n\u201cSeeker Temple\u201d  - A green beginner map briefly exploring mechanics from chapter 5, Mirror Temple, including seekers. Map by  Cat_in_Box_01 .\n\u201cThoughtful Dreams\u201d  - A green beginner map exploring the unique dash mechanics of Chapter 8, Core.

Map by  Lichtbaulb .\n\u201cHeavenly  Altitudes\u201d \u00a0 - A yellow beginner map, primarily based on getting through a spinner obstacle course with  Badeline \u00a0orbs. Map by  Abby .\n\u201cAzurite Ascent\u201d  - A yellow beginner map utilizing various mechanics. It is well known for its atmospheric presentation. Map by  CANADIAN .\n\u201cSpace Jam Fever Dream\u201d  - A yellow beginner map centered around the modded mechanic of dashing while inside a dream block to change direction. It is known for its easter egg referencing YouTuber CarlSagan42. Made by  cruor . (aka \u201cSJFD\u201d)\n\u201cBlast Processing\u201d  - A yellow beginner puzzle map centered around the mechanics of light beams used to activate doors, as well as color-coded zip blocks. Map by  Flagpole1up .\n\u201cThe Singularity\u201d  - A yellow beginner map that uses small dream blocks. Map by  Ghajestis .\n\u201c Badeline \u00a0Block Belt\u201d \u00a0- A yellow beginner map exploring moving block cycles from chapter 6. Map by  hennyburgr .\n\u201cTemple of the Kevins\u201d  - A yellow beginner map centered around Kevins. (see also, Kevins.) The map is well known for its presentation, with the tiles being composed entirely of Kevins, and music made with the soundfont of Kevin\u2019s voice. It is also known for its connection to the grandmaster map, Crypt of the Kevins, also from the Spring Collab. (aka \u201cTotK\u201d, not to be confused with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.) Map by  iamdadbod .\n\u201cMossy Caverns\u201d  - A yellow beginner map which mostly takes place underwater, with an added oxygen mechanic. Map by  itsabrody . (aka \" Maverns \")\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s Outer Space\u201d  - A yellow beginner dashless dark map by  Rue .\n\u201cInto the Storm\u201d  - A simple yellow beginner level utilizing red bubbles and conveyor belts. Map by  Snas .\n\u201cChillout Mountain\u201d  - A yellow beginner dashless map using the snowball mechanic from Chapter 4, Golden Ridge, set to LoFi music.

Map by  DanTKO .\n\u201cCirque  Maderano \u201d \u00a0 - A red beginner map exploring the mechanics of moving platforms with springs and spikes, taking place in a circus tent. (aka \u201cCM\u201d, not to be confused with Cycle Madness, another Spring Collab map using the same abbreviation.) Map by  Skeleton .\n\u201cBeginner Heart Side\u201d  - The final challenge of the Spring Collab 2020 beginner lobby, with a section of each room dedicated to each of the maps from the lobby. Map made primarily by  Bissy . (aka \"BHS\", \u201cscbhs\u201d.)\nSC2020 Intermediate Lobby\n\u201cJots and Scribbles\u201d  - A green intermediate map centered around springs, with graphics that appear to be composed of pencil scribbles. Map by  Chloe . \u00a0 (aka \"Jibbles\")\n\u201cOvergrown City\u201d  - A green intermediate map themed around Forsaken City, with plant growth overtaking structures. This map primarily uses zip blocks to time the player through each section. Map by  Lichtbaulb .\n\u201cSerene Skydive\u201d  - A unique green intermediate map taking place as a freefall through an obstacle of spinners. It uses several extended variants, such as infinite dashes and a dash length reduction to let the player play at their own pace. Map by  Thegur90 .\n\u201cAbandoned and Ruined\u201d  \u00a0- A yellow intermediate map themed around a more ruined version of Chapter 3, Celestial Resort. Map by  aleph_null.\n\u201cElectrified Resort\u201d  - A yellow intermediate map themed around Chapter 3, Celestial Resort, with electricity fields and jellyfish.

(aka \u201cUD\u201d) Map by  Bob Dole .\n\"Heart of the  Storm\" \u00a0 (aka \u201cHotS\u201d) - A cracked-red map centered around ultras,  cornerboosts , and backboosts, with high input density and precision, widely regarded as the hardest map in SC2020 besides the grandmaster heart sides. Map by  CANADIAN .\n- At the end of the final strawberry room in Heart of the Storm is a section labeled \u201ca nice view\u201d, aka \u201canv\u201d. This is regarded to be the hardest individual segment in the entirety of Spring Collab 2020 outside of the grandmaster heart side, and there is no reward for completing it except a pleasant view of some clouds. (Sometimes, a highly difficult secret room placed at the end of a map with no rewards is referred to as a \u2018nice view\u2019 or \u2018anv\u2019 in reference to this map.)\n\"Grandmaster Heart Side (New)\u201d \u00a0- (aka \u201cngmhs\u201d) The final challenge of the Spring Collab 2020 grandmaster lobby, and of spring collab as a whole. Like the expert heart side, each flag is dedicated to two maps, save for the final three. (See also, \u2018Grandmaster Heart Side (Old)\u2019)\n- Flag 2 of ngmhs contains an infamous segment in the beginning where Madeline must perform five backboosts in rapid succession, teleporting back to catch the jellyfish she throws. The community usually refers to this portion as the \u201ctornado\u201d due to Madeline\u2019s rapid cyclic movement and the cloudy theme of this flag. Flag 2 of ngmhs is widely regarded to be the hardest flag in ngmhs and the second hardest room in Spring Collab 2020, behind a nice view.\n\"Grandmaster Heart Side (Old)\u201d \u00a0- (aka \u201cogmhs\u201d) The old grandmaster heart side was the previous final challenge of Spring Collab 2020 before being replaced with ngmhs. Ogmhs was poorly received by the community due to its poor quality. The map still exists within Spring Collab, now only being accessible using debug mode in the room transition between F7 and F6 of ngmhs.\n\u201cI Wanna Atone the Flower: Celeste Remake\u201d -  A dashless map by  Araxon \u00a0based on the game \u201cI Wanna Atone the Flower''. Its gameplay consists of a series of short, symmetrical single screen challenges requiring the player to navigate tight rows of spikes.

The map includes many easter eggs, including the humorous character Jash, complete with an Undertale-style boss battle, as well as hidden maps accessible only through solving an ARG. Gamation uploaded a  YouTube Video \u00a0covering this ARG.\n\"Monika's D-Sides Pack\" \u00a0- One of the oldest campaign mods in Celeste, the full name being \"The D-Side Pack IV, the Resolutive Dance of Madeline and Monika\". These maps are based on the Vanilla chapters 1 - 9. They are often abbreviated as [Chapter Number]D (e.g. \"2D\" for Old Site D-Side), but are sometimes also abbreviated with an \"M\" in front to denote \"Monika's\" due to other mappers making their own D-Side packs (e.g. \"M5D\" for Mirror Temple D-Side). Final Goodbye, sometimes referred to as 9D, has Golden Strawberries that are collected by doing several consecutive checkpoints deathless, and a Platinum Strawberry for completing the whole map deathless.\n\u201cFore\u201d  - a map by Scraggly1 combining Farewell and Core.

These maps consist of several extremely short, input-dense rooms which necessitate the use of retention tech to complete. The B-side is listed as a 2* on hardlist; the A-side and B-side used to both be required, but it was updated to only require the B-side since the A-side does not meet the standard of a 1*.

Its name is a misnomer, as it is in fact not a \u2018garbage version\u2019 of Chapter 5B from the base game; instead, it is a \u2018garbage version\u2019 of Chapter 7D, Summit, a custom map also made by Monika (see also, \u2018Monika\u2019s D sides\u2019). It is also a 1* map on Hardlist. (aka \u201c5BGV\u201d)\n\"Serotonin\" \u00a0-  A hard dashless gm map composed out of geometric shapes and several checkpoints tightly condensed onto a single screen.

Map by  gtfo .\n\"Half Stamina City\" \u00a0-  a hard  gm map \u00a0made by  InverseHackermann . This map intends precise  \u201chalf stamina climbs\u201d which used to be considered \u2018TAS only\u2019  before multiple people discovered they can be made easier using keybinds (though also viable without) . Ironically, the map is technically possible without the use of any half stamina climbs at all.\n\"Vivid Abyss\" \u00a0- A high grandmaster map made by ABuffZucchini. It explores the interactions between some vanilla entities (dream blocks, clouds, kevins and later zi movers and dash blocks) with a large amount of grandmaster tech too. It has a moonbery checkpoint containing rooms inspired by other maps. This full clear of this map \u00a0 is a 1* on hardlist. \u00a0  \u00a0 (aka \"Vbyss\", \"Vabyss\", or \u201cVA\u201d, not to be confused with the State of Virginia.)\n\u201cMauve\u201d \u00a0- a gm+1 map by smoothee.

The initial version of the map was one of the most notoriously difficult maps for its time. Later on, fishtank created a version that was nerfed in difficulty, removing many of the buffs and turning it from a GM+1 map to an Expert map harder than 7D. To distinguish between the old version and new version, they are sometimes abbreviated as \u201co7d1d\u201d and \u201cn7d1d\u201d, respectively.\n\"118.71% FulFilled Emptiness\"  A gm+1 dashless map utilizing extremely precise tech and with unsettling, minimal monochrome visuals.

The map listed as a 2* on Hardlist, and is unable to be downloaded off of Gamebanana, instead only being available through a Google Drive Link found on hardlist.

These maps are both designed as extremely tight corridors lined with hazards that require the player to use precise tech to traverse. CPVL is designed horizontally, with the player moving rightwards, while LXVI is designed vertically, with the player moving upwards. The naming convention for these maps follows a pattern of two letters in a word being replaced with another random letter. \u2018moce\u2019 is nice, \u2018cpvl\u2019 is cave, and \u2018lxvi\u2019 is love. CPVL used to be called \u201cCPCL\u201d, which stood for  cock , spelling out nice// cock . This change was made due to issyy wanting //MOCE// to be a serious campaign, and the joke name CPCL did not suit this tone.\n\"Shatter Site\" \u00a0- a dashless map made by  AstralightSky . This map is infamous for its gameplay, being unplaytested and requiring numerous precise techniques to complete. The map\u2019s setting is a variant on Chapter 2, Old Site. (The map is jokingly abbreviated as \"Shite\" due to its low reputation among the Celeste community.)\n\"Avian Ascension\" \u00a0- the hardest gm+1 map in celeste made by the popular Celeste YouTuber  parrot_dash .  The map is based off of the 2500M checkpoint of the map \u2018D1D7\u2019 , resulting in mechanics and decoration from the Mirror Temple . It is the hardest 2* map on hardlist. (aka \"AA\", \u201cascension\u201d)\n\"Crystal Garden\" \u00a0- A short map made by  Etpio . This map has a storied history, with Parrot Dash being the first to clear it after routing it in secret. This was formally the \u00a0 \u00a0easiest 3* map on hardlist, used as the standard to determine if a map belongs in the 2* or 3* category. Clears for hardlist are accepted for any version after v1.4 and before v1.6. (aka \"cg\")\n- The second room of Crystal Garden (aka \u201ccg2\u201d) is by far the hardest in the map, being incredibly long and extremely complicated to route. The route used by Parrot Dash in his first clear was actually not the intended route, and has since been patched. It is rumored that nobody, not even the map\u2019s creator, knows the intended route to clear room 2.\n\"Madeline Votes in the  2020 \u00a0US Presidential Election D-Side\" \u00a0- A dashless map made by Jan. This is the final map in the \u201cMadeline votes in the 2020 US Presidential Election\u201d map pack, but is separate from the rest of the maps. This map is considered a joke, as the map is filled with crude dialogue and memes. This map is a lot harder than any other map in the pack, and is a 3* map on hardlist. \u00a0(aka \"delection\" or \u201celection d\u201d )\n\u201cD1D7\u201d \u00a0 - An extremely difficult  etselec \u00a0map of \u20187D1D\u2019 by fishtank_underflow. This map is a 3* on Hardlist, formerly the most difficult map cleared. One notable room in this map is:\n- \u201c2k-3\u201d \u00a0- A nickname for the 3rd room of the 2000m checkpoint in the original 7D1D. In D1D7, it is an insanely difficult dropper room with multiple, incredibly tight gaps, some being pixel-perfect, requiring near TAS-level movement down to the subpixels (see also, \u201cSubpixel\u201d and \u201cTool-assisted speedrunning\u201d). Formerly the most difficult room cleared in Celeste.\n\u201cDashless+\u201d \u00a0- A buffed version of Chapter 1A, Forsaken City, which continues after the Forsaken City section into an original creation. It is a 3* map on Hardlist, (see also, \u2018hardlist\u2019,) and  is currently  considered the hardest custom map to ever be cleared. (aka \u201cD+\u201d). A particularly difficult room at the end is split into four segments, referred to by the community as \u201cQuarter 1\u201d, \u201cQuarter 2\u201d, \u201cQuarter 3\u201d, and \u201cQuarter 4\u201d, respectively. (aka \u201cQ1\u201d, \u201cQ2\u201d, \u201cQ3\u201d, and \u201cQ4\u201d.) This is widely regarded in the community as the hardest room ever cleared. (aka \u201cD+ final\u201d, \u201cD+24\u201d , or \u201c24\u201d)\n\u201cSuperfecta\u201d - \u00a0 Missing descriptor\n\u201c Flusheline \u00a0Community Collab\u201d \u00a0 Missing Descriptor  - (aka FLCC)\nSpeedrunning Terminology\nSpeedrunning is a style of playing a game with the goal of completing the game in as little time as possible, often competing against others for the best time. Below is a list of terms used in the Celeste community which are frequently, but not exclusively, used in the context of speedrunning the game, or other  adjacent practices, such as deathless runs.\n\u201cDeathless\u201d \u00a0- This refers to any challenge run or speedrun which requires no deaths throughout the entire playthrough.\n\u201cFull Clear\u201d  - These runs entail playing through an entire chapter or custom map, or sometimes an entire collab or lobby, while collecting every strawberry, and the cassette and crystal heart if applicable. (aka \u201cFC\u201d)\n\u201cLow Death\u201d -  A way of stating the lowest number of deaths you have gotten in a run of a particular map/checkpoint , generally used when practicing. For example, \u201cFW low death 12\u201d means that you have done a complete clear of Farewell in twelve deaths. \u201cRM low death 3\u201d would mean that you\u2019ve done the Remembered checkpoint from Farewell in three deaths.\n\u201cPersonal Best\u201d  - A personal record for lowest deaths, lowest time, or most progress on a screen or map without dying is called a \u201cpersonal best\u201d or \u201cPB\u201d for short.\n\u201cSpeedrun Category\u201d \u00a0- Speedruns of nearly every game, including Celeste, have multiple categories, which have different requirements for a speedrun to be valid. Below is a list of Celeste\u2019s main speedrun categories, taken from  speedrun.com :  [ba]\n- \u201c100%\u201d - Complete all chapters, collect all 175 red berries, and collect the moon berry from a new file. (Most games have a 100% category for speedrunning.)\n- \u201cAll Cassettes\u201d - Collect all 8 Cassette Tapes and complete Chapter 8A from a new file.\n- \u201cAll Hearts\u201d - Collect all 24 hearts from a new file.\n- \u201cAll Red Berries\u201d (aka \u201cARB\u201d) - Collect all 175 red berries and complete Chapter 8A from a new file. (\u2018ARB\u2019 is also a general term used to mean simply collecting all red berries.)\n- \u201cAny%\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file. (Most games have an Any% category for speedrunning. It simply requires the player to beat the main game.)\n- \u201cBny%\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file without completing any A-Sides.\n- \u201cTrue Ending\u201d - Complete Farewell from a new file.\nSome less common speedrun categories include:\n- \u201c1-UP in Four Chapters\u201d - Obtain a 1-Up in four separate chapters. Use of Cheat Mode is allowed.\n- \u201c202 Berries\u201d - Collect all 202 strawberries, all 24 hearts, all 8 tapes, and complete all chapters from a new file. (aka \u201cMax%\u201d, \u201cTrue Max%\u201d)\n- \u201c25 Golden Berries\u201d - Collect 25 golden berries from a new file. You are not required to play the chapter Farewell. Use of cheat mode is allowed.\n- \u201cAll Cassettes Cheat Mode\u201d - Collect all 8 Cassette Tapes from a new file. 8a does not need to be completed.

This category has only ever been completed by runner \u2018Rickfernello\u2019.  His video completing this challenge can be seen here. \u00a0This category is not documented on speedrun.com.\n- \u201cPre DLC\u201d - Complete all chapters available in patches before 1.3.0.0 from a new file. (This category serves mainly as an archive for Any% runs that occurred prior to the release of the Farewell DLC on December 9th, 2019.)\n- \u201cPrologue\u201d - Complete Prologue from a new file.\n\u201cSave States\u201d -  Save states (aka \u2018states\u2019) are a functionality which allows the player to reload a Celeste screen to a certain chosen point. They are commonly used in other games, especially modded games and emulators. They are especially used by modded Celeste players to practice hard screens, at a certain difficulty when it becomes harder to make progress without the use of save states. A \u201cdead state\u201d refers to when a player sets a save state at a point which is guaranteed to kill them, or that makes progress impossible. \u201cStateless\u201d is used to refer to when a player clears something without using save states.\n\u201cTool-assisted Speedrunning\u201d \u00a0- A category of speedrunning where inputs are written by one or more people to be read back and performed in real time by a bot. This is also used outside of the Celeste community. Maps or challenges that are too difficult or impossible to be performed by a human, but can be performed by a bot, are referred to as \u201cTAS only\u201d. (aka \u201cTAS\u201d.)\nCommunity Resources\nBelow is a list of Celeste\u2019s most frequented community resources.\n\u201cAhorn\u201d  - A map making software for Celeste currently not being worked on. Its replacement, L\u00f6nn, is currently being worked on and actively improved. Because L\u00f6nn is not yet finished, some mappers may still prefer Ahorn. Ahorn is built into Olympus as a one button launch.\n\u201cCeleste\u2019s Hardest Maps Clear List\u201d \u00a0- A collection of the most difficult (non TAS-only) custom Celeste maps that have been cleared by a human. \u00a0 Celeste's Hardest Maps Clear List can be found here. \u00a0Maps on the hardlist are classified in terms of  one star, two stars, and three stars, abbreviated as \u201c1*\u201d, \u201c2*\u201d, and \u201c3*\u201d, respectively [bb] . The more stars, the harder the map. \u00a0( aka \"hardlist\", \u00a0\u201chist\u201d, \u201chlist\u201d, or \u201ch-list\u201d .)\n\u201cCeleste Discord\u201d \u00a0- Celeste\u2019s official Discord server! This is the central hub of the Celeste community. They can be joined at  https://discord.gg/celeste . (aka \" celestecord \" or \" clord \")\n\u201c Celestenet \u201d  - An extremely popular Celeste mod that allows for some multiplayer connectivity, such as seeing other players in real time, grabbing them, or jumping off of their heads. The game world, such as the position of Theo or whether a falling block has fallen, is localized to each individual player. Account setup and download is available at  https://celestenet.0x0a.de/ .\n\"Custom Map Golden Strawberry List\" \u00a0- A collection of deathless runs achieved for various modded maps. The  Custom Map Golden Strawberry List \u00a0can be found here.  Completed goldens and silvers of individual maps are placed into the Standard Golden List, which are a comparable difficulty to most vanilla goldens, or the Hard Golden List, which are above the difficulty of the Hell Trio.\nThe Hard Golden List is also ranked in the Top Golden List, where the bottom, Tier 7, is for goldens/silvers just harder than the Hell Trio. Difficulty rises as the tier number descends, where Tier 0 is currently the hardest achieved golden. Farewell Golden serves as the bottom of Tier 3, and tiers 0-3 are also ranked by subcategories designated by the cell fill saturation. Maps easier than tier 3 are listed in tiers/subcategories in alphabetical order. Tiers are often abbreviated by \"T#\", where a Tier 4 golden would be referred to as a T4. (aka \"molden list\")\n\u201cEverest\u201d  - The mod loader for Celeste, available on  github \u00a0or  gamebanana . Everest is built into Olympus as a one button launch.\n\u201cGamebanana\u201d -  A website \u00a0for hosting a variety of games and mods. Gamebanana is the standard platform for hosting Celeste mods, although some are simply uploaded to Google Drive.\n\u201cL\u00f6nn\u201d  - The map making software for Celeste, currently being worked on by several talented programmers. It is unfinished as of now, so mappers may still prefer Ahorn. L\u00f6nn is built into Olympus as a one button launch, though this is only accessible through the settings menu first. (aka \"Loenn\".)\n\"Olympus\" \u00a0- A convenient GUI made for quick access to unmodified Celeste, Everest, Ahorn, L\u00f6nn, downloaded mods, Gamebanana, and more, available on  github \u00a0or  gamebanana ..\nCommunity References\nBelow is a list of references and inside jokes frequently used by the Celeste community.\n\u201c1170\u201d  - An infamous death that circled around the celeste community for a while. This death features celeste player \u201cShye\u201d playing 2k3 [requires its own section, possibly under D1D7] in celeste map \u2018D1D7\u2019 (see also, \u2018D1D7\u2019) before passing the hardest gap at the end and not pushing any buttons to move into the final gap. This death is a meme due to the immense discord posts showcasing the death as a reaction.\n\u201cBonk\u201d  - community term for when Madeline hits her head on an object, usually after a wall bounce. is used frequently outside of the Celeste community as well.\n\u201cBurgy\u201d \u00a0- A cross between Kirby and a burger, which is a common emote in the Celeste Community, and often seen as a mascot. ( if anyone knows the origins feel free to add that [bc] )\n\u201cCarwash\u201d \u00a0- Sometimes used to refer to wavedashes or failed wavedashes, this term comes from the  mod  Celeste, Google Translated Edition \u00a0where, during the wavedash tutorial presentation, the text \u201cWith Wavedashing, you can jump very far and regain your dash  at the same time! \u201d is replaced with \u201c Carwash \u00a0allows you to go through windows simultaneously.\u201d\n\u201cComf\u201d \u00a0- short for \u2018comfy,\u2019 this is a community term for when Madeline crouches in a one-block high gap.\n\u201cFrogeline\u201d \u00a0- One of the many emotes used in the Celeste Discord server, this  emote \u00a0is often used to celebrate or congratulate other users\u2019 accomplishments. It depicts Madeline as a frog with a gaping mouth.\n\u201cHell Trio\u201d  - A community term for three golden strawberries in celeste, 6bg, 7bg, and 8bg, which were each considered collectively as the hardest challenges in the game prior to the release of the Chapter 9 update, when the Farewell golden strawberry became Celeste\u2019s pen ultimate \u00a0challenge. These serve as the baseline for custom modded map goldens/silvers to be on the Hard Golden List.\nDisorganized and Miscellaneous Entries\nAny entries that have not yet been sorted or cannot be sorted into a specific category will go here.\n\u201c0 framed\u201d \u00a0- (aka \u201c0f\u201d) A phenomenon which can happen due to the way Celeste calculates the position of a moving entity at any given moment. All movement in the game is tied to frames, and Celeste has a default frame rate of 60 frames per second. From one frame to another, the player\u2019s position, for example, is calculated to have been moved by a certain number of pixels, and they are never considered to be present in between those positions. This makes it possible to clip through hazards without interacting with them at high enough speeds, as there are zero frames where the hazard can interact with Madeline. An example of this phenomenon is hitting a spiked Kevin using a green booster. This also makes certain actions impossible at high speeds, since there are no frames where the player is in the correct position to perform said action.\n\u201cCollab\u201d \u00a0- Collabs are packs of maps made by several map creators.  (Collabs are all independent projects. Other similarly named collabs are not necessarily affiliated with one another. For example, Winter Collab 2021 is not affiliated with Spring Collab 2020.)\n\u201c Strawberry Jam Collab\u201d \u00a0- A large mod released in 2023. (aka \u201cStrawberry Jam\u201d, \u201cSJ2023\u201d, or \"SJ\".)  (Anything specifically associated with Strawberry Jam Collab will be given red text.)\n(See Custom Maps section below for more information!)\n\u201c Spring Collab 2020\u201d \u00a0- A large mod released in 2020. Prior to Strawberry Jam Collab, this was the largest and most well known Celeste mod.  (aka \u201cSC2020\u201d, \u201cSpring Collab\u201d, or \u201cSC\u201d.)  (Anything specifically associated with Spring Collab 2020 will be given green text.) (See Custom Maps section below for more information!)\n\u201cSilver Strawberry\u201d \u00a0- These are essentially the same as a golden strawberry, as they are obtained from completing the map without dying. They are often used in maps in collabs, as they represent that maps in collabs are often shorter than an average map. Similarly to goldens, silver strawberries are abbreviated with an \"S\" at the end, for example, Treehive Silver would be \"TreehiveS\". \u00a0(aka \u201csilver\u201d)\n\u201cRainbow Strawberry\u201d \u00a0 - Spoilers for Spring Collab, Strawberry Jam, and other collabs and contests.  These are obtained in certain collabs and/or contests, including Spring Collab and Strawberry Jam Collab, as a reward for collecting every silver strawberry in a lobby.\n\"Speed Berry\" \u00a0- Appearing as a yellow strawberry with a clock, this strawberry serves as a speedrunning challenge for players. Speed Berries have bronze, silver, and gold times, which require increasingly optimized completions of the map.  These appear in Spring Collab 2020 and a few other collabs.\n\"Alternate Sides\"  - It is common for maps to indicate that they are simply a harder version of another map by following it with a letter, followed by the word \u201cside.\u201d This is an expansion of the B-Side and C-Side system of the vanilla game. This is most commonly done with D-Sides.\n\u201cDifficulty\u201d \u00a0- Maps are generally categorized by difficulty. The five main difficulties are  \u201cbeginner\u201d ,  \u201cintermediate\u201d ,  \u201cadvanced\u201d ,  \u201cexpert\u201d , and  \u201cgrandmaster\u201d . (These are often abbreviated in order as beg/bg, int, adv, ex/exp, and gm) This difficulty delineation was popularized by Spring Collab 2020 and is the most widely used, including in Strawberry Jam.\nThe difficulties, in comparison to vanilla Celeste, are as follows:\n- Beginner : \u00a0The same as most of the game\u2019s main story chapters (A-sides).\n- Intermediate :  Most of the game\u2019s B-sides and C-sides fall in this category.\n- Advanced : \u00a0 Some of Celeste\u2019s most difficult rooms reach low advanced territory.\n- Expert : \u00a0Expert is beyond the difficulty of anything in vanilla Celeste.\n- Grandmaster :  Grandmaster is also well beyond the difficulty of anything in vanilla.\nIn addition, c olors are used to denote the difficulties of maps found in these categories, green being the least difficult, yellow being in the middle, and red being the most difficult, indicated by an image of a meter. Additionally, maps that are notably harder than even the hardest GM maps are often referred to as GM+, and a cracked meter is used to represent these maps in collabs (see \u2018Cracked\u2019).\n\"Celestial\" \u00a0- The term \u201cCelestial\u201d is a suggested alternative to the gm+x format to indicate maps which are harder than grandmaster, but it is not widely used by the Celeste community.\n\u201cCracked\u201d \u00a0- Sometimes \u201ccracked red\u201d, these refer to maps given cracked difficulty, used in grandmaster maps to indicate maps that are beyond the typical spectrum of grandmaster difficulty. These maps are sometimes referred to as \u201cgm+\u201d. The number after \u2018gm+\u2019 indicates how many difficulty thresholds it is above a typical grandmaster level; for example, a gm+2 map is two difficulty categories above grandmaster, just like how advanced is two categories above beginner. Anything above gm+2 is seldom agreed upon. The term \u201ccracked\u201d comes from the fact that, in the difficulty color meter used in various collabs, the pointer is pushed so far to the right that it goes past red and causes the meter\u2019s glass cover to crack.\n\u201cLobby\u201d \u00a0- A map made for selecting other maps, frequently used in collabs. These are often sorted by difficulty (e.g. expert lobby, beginner lobby, etc.)\n\u201cGym\u201d  - Maps made solely for teaching techniques to players. These maps are common to include in collabs and are often sorted by difficulty, similarly to lobbies.\n\u201cHeart Side\u201d \u00a0- a type of map frequently placed at the end of a lobby in a  collab , popularized by Spring Collab. They  are typically \u00a0 a collection of  all the other maps in a lobby.  These maps are typically longer and more difficult than others in its difficulty category. These are frequently given prefixes to indicate what difficulty they are: \u201cBHS\u201d for beginner, \u201cIHS\u201d for intermediate, \u201cAHS\u201d for advanced, \u201cEHS\u201d or occasionally \u201cEXHS\u201d for expert, and \u201cGMHS\u201d for grandmaster. Oftentimes the \"heart\" portion is replaced by another word, such as the Winter Collab 2021 Fusionside serving as that  collab's \u00a0heart side.\n\u201cDashless\u201d  - Just as it sounds, these are maps or challenges that disallow Madeline from dashing.\n\u201cDark Map\u201d \u00a0- Describes a decoration style that turns tiles and entities into dark silhouettes to contrast the background. (e.g., Crimson Night, Heaven\u2019s Outer Space) (aka \"Silhouette Map\") . This may also refer to maps which obscure the map until lit up, such as the depths subchapter of chapter 5A from vanilla Celeste.\n\u201cEtselec\u201d \u00a0- Literally the word \u201cCeleste\u201d backwards, these maps are backwards versions of other maps, where rooms are completed in reverse order from end to beginning with minimal changes made to keep them possible. (See also, D1D7.)\n\u201cGarbage Version\u201d \u00a0- Modified versions of existing maps, but spammed with the moving saw blade entity from chapter 5. These maps are typically abbreviated with \u201c GV\u201d at \u00a0the end of their abbreviation. CMGV, for example, is a garbage version of the map Cycle Madness. Occasionally, Garbage Versions are made with the base of another Garbage Version, resulting in often TAS-only maps like CMGVGV and CMGVGVGV.\n\u201c Techspam\u201d -  A style of gameplay that revolves around using lots of tech in quick succession, typically with high input density. Maps using this style are usually expert or higher in difficulty due to the nature of it. An example of this style is the map \u201cS.B.W.W.\u201d.\n\u201cSave and Quit\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cs+q\u201d, \u201cs&q\u201d, \u201cs and q\u201d, \u201csq\u201d)- Saving and quitting is an option in the Celeste pause menu. Selecting it brings the player to the main menu, wherein whenever they choose to continue, they will continue where they left off in a chapter. \u00a0Saving and quitting counts as a death and removes the player\u2019s golden strawberry if they have one.\n\u201cDreadcorner\u201d \u00a0- The name of a strategy in the chapter 5 B-side used to skip a portion of the chapter, performed by doing a spiked cornerjump on the right side of the room where Madeline would normally require using a red booster. It is called this, as it is the faster alternative to the \u2018bubsdrop\u2019 that can be performed in this room, but is much more difficult.", "image_urls": [], "image_captions": [], "cv_analysis": [], "chunks": [{"chunk_id": 0, "text": "Welcome to the Celeste Dictionary!

Table of Contents Vanilla Celeste - Vanilla Entities - Custom Entities - Vanilla Techniques and Game Mechanics - Custom Techniques and Game Mechanics - Custom Maps - Speedrunning Terminology - Community Resources - Community References - Disorganized and Miscellaneous Entries - Notes - Vanilla Celeste \u2018Vanilla\u2019 items are any items which can be found within the base game of Celeste, without mods. Below is a list of chapters, collectables, and other phenomena found within vanilla Celeste. \"Sides / Chapters\" - Each chapter in Celeste refers to a playable location such as Old Site (Chapter 2) or Mirror Temple (Chapter 5). Each chapter has an A-Side, B-Side, and C-Side, except for Chapter 9, Farewell. These can be abbreviated with the suffix of -A, -B, and -C respectively. For example, Forsaken City A-Side is 1A, and Golden Ridge B-Side is 4B. For more information, see the List of Celeste Chapters . - \u201cA-side\u201d - The A-side of the chapter is the primary part of the chapter. Between A-sides, B-sides, and C-sides, A-sides are the easiest but longest, and are the only \u2018side\u2019 with any bearing on the plot. Along with strawberries, each A-side has a collectable hidden cassette tape as well as a blue crystal heart which often requires puzzle-solving. - \u201cB-side\u201d - B-sides are an unlockable challenge version of a chapter, significantly more difficult than the A-side. B-sides are non-canon and have no collectable strawberries besides the ubiquitous golden strawberry. Each B-side ends with a collectable red crystal heart. - \u201cC-side\u201d - C-sides are the final unlockable \u2018side\u2019 of a chapter, and are harder than B-sides. Each C-side is generally three rooms long, with the final room"}, {"chunk_id": 1, "text": "being the most difficult, making C-sides the shortest chapters in Celeste. Like B-sides, they are non-canon and have no collectable strawberries. Each C-side ends with a collectable yellow crystal heart. Prologue and Epilogue are chapters without alternate sides or collectables, they aren't shown in the Journal, and they have no abbreviation, as they are very short and lack any significant challenge. \u201cCassette\u201d - Every chapter A-side contains a collectable cassette found in a hidden room. These hidden rooms play a chip-tune music track in the background and have \u2018cassette blocks\u2019 which activate and deactivate in rhythm with the music. Collecting a cassette unlocks the B-side of the chapter. \u201cCrystal Heart\u201d - Floating heart shaped crystals with one found in each chapter. A-sides have blue crystal hearts, found somewhere hidden in the level. B-sides have red crystal hearts which serve as the end goal of the chapter. Likewise, C-sides have yellow crystal hearts which serve as the end goal of the chapter. A-Side and B-Side hearts are also individually named. \"Farewell\" - Chapter 9 of Celeste added in a free DLC on September 9th, 2019. It is far longer and more difficult than all other chapters of Celeste, and requires at least 15 Crystal Hearts to access any content past the Remembered checkpoint. This requirement can be bypassed with some tech usage. The golden strawberry for this chapter, abbreviated as \"FWG\", is widely regarded as the ultimate challenge in Celeste. The final checkpoint of Farewell is called \u2018Farewell\u2019, and to avoid confusion, this checkpoint is referred to as \"Farewell/Farewell\" or \"FWFW\". \u201cStrawberry\u201d - Strawberries are Celeste\u2019s main collectible. There are 175 main strawberries that count towards 100% completing the game, plus 27 extra strawberries that do not count towards this, for a final total of 202. Collecting six of any of these in a short period will display consecutive 1000-point rewards, starting from 1000 and increasing up to 5000, and finally displaying the text \u20181-UP\u2019 along with giving the 1UP! achievement. These points and the 1-UP are purely cosmetic, and are a reference to retro-era video games such as Super Mario World. The various types of strawberries in Celeste include: - \u201cRed Strawberry\u201d - The default strawberry type. Although the exact specific mechanics of these strawberries depends on the particular strawberry, most cannot be collected unless the player is standing on solid ground in a safe area. These strawberries count towards 100% completion. - \u201cWinged Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cwinged berry\u201d) - The second most common strawberry type. These strawberries function the same as red strawberries, with the added caveat that the strawberry will attempt to fly away if the player dashes in the room in which it is contained. These strawberries count towards 100% completion. - \u201cSeeded Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cstrawberry seeds\u201d, \u201cseed berry\u201d)- To collect these strawberries, the player must collect a series of strawberry seeds within a room without touching the ground, which will result in the seeds returning to their position. If successful,"}, {"chunk_id": 2, "text": "a cutscene will play and the seeds will manifest as a collectable red strawberry. These strawberries count towards 100% completion. - \u201cGolden Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cgolden\u201d) - Each of Celeste\u2019s chapters, as well as their B-sides and C-sides, has one golden strawberry, requiring the player to complete the chapter without dying to obtain, with the exception of Prologue and Epilogue. A distinct death sound will play if the player dies while carrying a golden strawberry. Each strawberry is referred to by taking the chapter\u2019s acronym and adding the suffix \u2018G\u2019; so the golden strawberry of the Chapter 1 A-side is 1AG, Chapter 4 C-side is 4CG, and of Farewell is \u201cFWG\u201d. This applies for custom maps as well. Golden strawberries become available after the player completes the chapter 8 B-side. These strawberries do not count towards 100% completion. - \u201cWinged Golden Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cwg \u201d or \u201c1A dashless\u201d) - The only winged golden strawberry in the game appears at the end of the chapter 1 A-side. It can only be found if the player completes the full chapter without dashing, although the strawberry will reappear if the player dies in the same room they dashed in before completing the room. This is one of Celeste\u2019s most difficult collectibles, requiring niche techniques that are required nowhere else in the game, including corner jumps, a 6jump, and a 4-tile overhang. This strawberry does not count towards 100% completion. - \u201cMoonberry\u201d (aka \u201cmb\u201d or, less commonly, \u201cmerry\u201d) - The only moonberry in the game sits in a hidden room within Farewell/Farewell, which can be entered if the player backtracks after clearing the electric fields. It appears as a green strawberry with a yellow \u2018Saturn ring\u2019 around it. Upon collecting it, the usual 1000 point indicator will be replaced with the flashing text \u201cWOW\u201d. Due to one of the rooms leading to it requiring the player to reset their respawn point and die to clear the room, it is the only collectable in the game which is completely impossible to collect without dying. Due to this, dying here while holding the golden strawberry is the only point in the game where the player will not be sent back to the beginning of the chapter when they die. This strawberry does not count towards 100% completion. \u201cVariants\u201d - A special menu unlocked after completing the C-side of Chapter 8, Core. It allows the player to change various settings about gameplay, such as the speed of time in-game a h d the amount of dashes one has. The settings are separated into two groups: variants and assists. A full list of the settings in the variants menu is found below: - Variants - \u201cGame Speed\u201d - Controls the speed of time in-game, which affects all movement, sounds and visuals in a level, This does not affect the chapter and file timers. The default value for this variant is 100%. The minimum is 50% and the maximum is 160% - \u201cMirror Mode\u201d - As its name implies, mirrors the screen in-game. Also changes the position of character"}, {"chunk_id": 3, "text": "portraits in dialogue boxes. - \u201c360 Dashing\u201d - Missing Descriptor - \u201cInvisible Motion\u201d - Madeline becomes invisible while moving, regardless if the player is holding the movement button s or not. - \u201cNo Grabbing\u201d - Madeline cannot grab onto walls, which makes climbjumping impossible. Certain blocks, such as the move blocks in Chapter 4, can still be activated by holding the grab button. - \u201cLow Friction\u201d - Greatly reduces Madeline\u2019s friction with the environment, making reducing her speed much more difficult. - \u201cSuper Dashing\u201d - Doubles the duration of Madeline\u2019s dash and gives her the ability to control the direction of her dash during one. (Not to be confused with the technique of the same name.) - \u201cHiccups\u201d - Madeline will start to hiccup every 1-2 seconds, causing her to be slightly launched upwards, even in mid-air. - \u201cOther Self\u201d - Turns Madeline into Badeline . Purely cosmetic variant. - Assists - \u201cInfinite Stamina\u201d - Gives madeline infinite energy to climb walls. - \u201cAir Dashes\u201d - Changes the amount of dashes Madeline has at any time. The settings for this are Default , 2 and Infinite . - \u201cDash Assist\u201d - When dashing, stops time while holding the dash button, allowing the player to precisely control the timing and direction of their dashes. - \u201cInvincibility\u201d - Makes Madeline invincible against all hazards. She will bounce on top of voids without dying to them; blocks that try to crush her will become non-solid; And, if she dashes into a wall through a Dream Block, she will bounce into the opposite direction. Vanilla Entities Vanilla entities are any entities which can be found in vanilla Celeste. Below is a list of vanilla entities. \u201c Badeline Chaser\u201d - Clones of Badeline that chase Madeline in Chapter 2, Old Site. They will be 2 seconds behind Madeline and will copy her moves exactly, killing her if touched. \u201cBooster\u201d - (aka \u201cbubble\u201d) Large bubbles that, shortly after being entered, launch the player in any direction they choose. There are two types of boosters: - Green: Introduced in Chapter 4, they quickly launch the player in a chosen direction before popping, covering a distance similar to that of a dash. - Red: Introduced in Chapter 5, they move in a chosen direction in a straight line indefinitely until they are popped by colliding with a solid or the player dashing out of them. \u201cCassette Bubble\u201d - After collecting a cassette, a large bubble envelops Madeline and brings her back to the start of the room. These bubbles are also used in Chapter 9, Farewell when collecting the keys in the Power Source checkpoint, where it would be impossible to return without them. Additionally, cassette bubbles are often used for strawberries in custom maps. (not to be confused with \u201cBooster\u201d, which is nicknamed \u201cbubble\u201d) \u201cCore Block\u201d - A block found in chapter 8, also known as Core. This block has two different abilities. It will launch the player if grabbed or landed on if it is in its lava"}, {"chunk_id": 4, "text": "state. However in its ice state it will crumble away. \u201cCore Switch\u201d - A switch found in Chapter 8, that causes the level to turn from lava to ice state or vice versa. This has various effects, such as making m adeline slide on the ground in ice mode, as well as entities such as core blocks and bumpers switching to a different variant. \u201cCrumble Block\u201d - Grey blocks found throughout the game, first in Chapter 1 that quickly \u201ccrumble\u201d after landing or climbing on them, causing them to become intangible. They quickly reform a short period after being broken, providing that no tiles are covering them. \u201cDream Block\u201d - The starry black blocks from Chapter 2. If these are dashed into, Madeline will continuously move through the block in the direction she dashed until she exits the block or hits a wall, the latter of which kills her. Exiting a dream block returns Madeline\u2019s dash. \u201cDust Bunny\u201d - The black and dark red creatures from Chapter 3, acting either as a static or moving obstacle. \u201cFeather\u201d - A golden feather introduced in Chapter 6, Reflection. When collected, it allows Madeline to fly in any direction for 2 seconds. While not holding in any direction, she will move much more slowly. A feather will regenerate Madeline\u2019s dash, unless she dashes out of it early. \u201cFlag\u201d - Respawn points denoted by the image of a flag, followed by a number. In the base game, they are used in Chapter 7, Summit, Sides A and B. They are also frequently used in mo d s. Flags typically count down ; so the lower the number, the closer the player is to the end. Certain flags may be abbreviated as f#, for instance, Flag 2 as F2. (Not to be confused with the #F format, which indicates the number of frames in which an action can be completed. See \u2018Frame Perfect.\u2019) \u201cHeart Gate\u201d - Large, blue walls of light with hearts on them, found on all sides of Chapter 8, Core, and halfway through Chapter 9, Farewell. They serve The hearts indicate how many crystal hearts the player must collect to open the heart gate. \u201cJellyfish\u201d - A large, parasol-shaped jellyfish introduced in Chapter 9, Farewell. When held, it will act like a parachute, greatly slowing Madeline\u2019s fall. Jellyfishes disappear when touching a seeker barrier (see below). \u201cKevin\u201d - The moving blocks with angry faces introduced in Chapter 6, Reflection, are referred to as \u2018Kevins\u2019. They get this name from the fact that they got their voices from Kevin, a developer. \u201cKey\u201d - Golden keys introduced in Chapter 3, Celestial Resort.. They are used to open locked doors and, therefore, are required to progress in a chapter. Once collected, the keys will follow Madeline around and will stay with her even if she dies. \u201cOshiro\u201d - The owner of the Celestial Resort Hotel in Chapter 3 (Celestial Resort), who turns into the main boss of the level in Presidential Suite. He periodically dashes from the right side of the screen to attack Madeline. The player may jump on"}, {"chunk_id": 5, "text": "Oshiro\u2019s head when he is dashing, with mechanics similar to that of the snowball or seeker entities. Being near Oshiro when he is dashing causes the game to slow down and the visuals to briefly turn black and white. \"Refill\" - Crystals that refill the player's dashes and stamina fully. The amount of dashes restored depends on the color and number of diamonds present. Green, singular crystals restore one dash, while pink, double crystals restore two. These can only be collected when the player lacks a dash or is flashing red due to having low stamina. Most of these will respawn after about two seconds when collected, but some will not respawn until dying or screen transitioning. \u201cSeeker\u201d - The monsters from the ends of Chapter 5, Mirror Temple A-Side and B-Side are referred to as \u2018seekers\u2019. These can be bounced off of, activate touch switches, break certain blocks, and are blocked by shimmering white Seeker Barriers that the player can pass through. \u201cSeeker Barrier\u201d - Transparent walls of light introduced in Chapter 5 which stop seekers from passing through them. They also cause any jellyfishes that touch them to disappear . \u201cSpinners\u201d - Balls of crystal spikes, often used as the main hazard in maps. The term \u2018spinner\u2019 originates from their name in the code, as they are called \u2018Static Crystal Spinners\u2019. - \u201cSpinner Juice\u201d - A nickname for a background substance that automatically fills the gaps between spinners when they are close enough. The substance is purely visual and does not kill you. \u201cSwap Block\u201d - Blocks with a red circle in the middle found in Chapter 5, Mirror Temple. These will quickly move to another position when the player dashes, and will slowly return afterwards. They can be used to quickly gain momentum. \u201cTheo Crystal\u201d - A large crystal containing Theo introduced in Chapter 5. When carrying him, Madeline will be weighed down, slowing her down and preventing her from dashing and climbing. If a Theo crystal falls into a death pit, he dies and causes Madeline to die with him. Certain doors exist which only open while Madeline is carrying a Theo crystal. \u201cTouch Switch\u201d - Often called \u201ccoins\u201d are t riggers that when interacted with can open switch gates, which are blocks that move when all touch switches are triggered. \"Zip Mover\" - Blocks on conveyor belts found in Chapter 1, Forsaken City. These quickly move to the end of the conveyor when the player touches them, and can be used for fast momentum gain. (aka \"traffic block\") Vanilla Techniques and Game Mechanics [a] [b] [c] Techniques, or \u201ctech\u201d for short, are certain actions the player can perform to achieve something. Game mechanics are any mechanic that informs the way Madeline and the environment interact; since the two are inextricably linked, they are listed together. Below is a list of techniques and mechanics that exist within the vanilla game. [d] \u201c5jump\u201d - Grabbing the side of a block above spikes just above where she can hang onto the block will cause Madeline to be repositioned lower down. Doing another climbjump before this happens will allow Madeline to jump from slightly higher than"}, {"chunk_id": 6, "text": "she normally can, crossing a larger gap. Normally she can only cross a four tile long row of spikes, but with this technique, she can cross five, hence \u201c5jump.\u201d \" 6jump \" - A dashless cornerboost , done by approaching the top corner of a tile with walking speed, then climbjumping off of it for additional speed. With this, the player can cross a 6-tile gap of spikes. \u201c 7jump \u201d - A dashless double cornerboost , done the same way as a 6jump, but pressing a second jump button shortly after the first and beginning slightly lower on the wall to account for this. \"8jump\" - A very difficult tech involv ing the same tech as a 7jump, but starting with +40 speed from a ground jump, and with a third non-cornerboosting climbjump added on. This cornerboost will give +0 speed, but is required for gaining slightly more height. If starting an 8jump with more speed, the third climbjump may not be required. This mechanic is extremely precise, being subpixel dependent. (see also, \u2018subpixels\u2019.) \u201c9jump\u201d - wallboost into dcb 4 frame perfect lmao wtf\u2026 this actually fucking exists [f] \u201c10jump\u201d - \u201c11jump\u201d - \u201cArc Ultra\u201d - \u201cArchie\u201d - Entering a booster in a crouched state causes the position of the booster to shift upwards slightly, as if Madeline is uncrouching within the bubble. This has applications in speedrunning and hard clears. It\u2019s named after a little green parrot named Archie! [g] \u201cBackboost\u201d (aka \u201cbboost\u201d) - When throwing a holdable, you gain a small speed boost in the opposite direction of the throw (8 0 speed ). In this technique, you must quickly turn around to throw the holdable behind you then turn back around. Spend as little time as possible moving in the direction of the throw to minimize speed loss and make use of the backboost. \u201cBino Clip\u201d - Binoculars can be used to scroll the camera to the side and unload spinners. Ending the interaction does not cause the camera to return immediately, so this slight delay can be used to pass through unloaded spinners before they load. \u201cBino Control Storage\u201d - In rare circumstances, for example skipping a cutscene while interacting with a bino, it is possible to cancel the dummy state that binoculars give you without canceling the interaction entirely. This results in being able to have control of Madeline while also controlling the camera using the binoculars. This is usually used in combination with spinner unloading, because spinners won\u2019t be loaded if they are outside of the camera. \u201cBino Interaction Storage\u201d (aka \u201cbino storage\u201d)- Interacting with binoculars for exactly one frame and jumping on the next frame tricks the game into thinking that Madeline is interacting with the binoculars when she is not. One of the consequences of this is that a dash through a screen transition gets canceled, which means that performing a grounded ultra through a screen transition allows the 1.2x speed boost to be retained past the end of the dash. \u201cBlock"}, {"chunk_id": 7, "text": "Boost'' - (aka \u201cblockboost\u201d) - There is a brief nine -frame window where after letting go of a moving block, such as a zip mover, where Madeline can perform a wall jump off of the block and gain momentum . (Not to be confused with \u2018liftboost\u2019, a game mechanic that enables block boosts to be performed.) \u201cBoost Holdable Storage\u201d - Releasing grab while holding a throwable when getting a boost from a fish or bumper causes a strange state to occur where Madeline acts for a short time as if she isn\u2019t holding a throwable, while visually she is. Madeline can dash in this state while seemingly holding the throwable (see \u201cThrowable Dash\u201d). If grabbed, Madeline does a pickup animation, and then the Madeline will be in the regular throwable grab state. If not grabbed, or Madeline does not dash, the throwable is thrown/dropped automatically after a short time after the boost. This tech was popularized by the strawberry room, \u201cExtra Ball\u201d in Pinball Purgatory, an infamous map from the strawberry jam collab. (aka \u201cExtra ball tech\u201d, \u201ceb tech\u201d, \u201cFreeze Frame Ungrab\u201d, \u201cbumper ungrab\u201d) \u201cBubble Super/Hyper\u201d - Dashing into a bubble (called a \u2018booster\u2019 in game files) from a grounded state allows you to input a super or hyper immediately as you enter the bubble and jump from the bubble as though it were solid ground. \u201cBubsdrop\u201d - A bubsdrop is a technique used to immediately enter a downwards screen transition after entering a room from below, by doing a short jump as you enter the room to gain less height than the screen transition would give. This is notable in the chapter 5 B-side, as it allows the player to skip a portion of the chapter by resetting the player\u2019s respawn point. This video showcases an example of this phenomenon. (see also, \u2018 dreadcorner \u2019) \u201cBuffer\u201d - A game mechanic present in many modern video games where if you input the controls to perform an action before your character is able, the game will read the input and perform the action as soon as it is able. In Celeste, for example, pressing the jump button shortly before coming in contact with the ground will still result in a jump. Most inputs can be buffered up to 5 frames, notable exceptions are buffering a pause out of a pause (6 frames) and grab/ slow fall which can be buffered infinitely. \u201cBumper Boost\u201d - Holding the direction away from a bumper while colliding with it will cause Madeline to be propelled away at a much higher speed and distance. Holding the direction towards the bumper will have the opposite effect. \u201cBumper Clip\u201d - After hitting a bumper, the player can dash towards the bumper and move through it, due to a lack of collision while the bumper is inactive. Performing this technique requires the player to initially contact the bumper at a precise angle. This tech is famously explored in the map \u2018Pinball Purgatory\u2019 from the Strawberry Jam Collab. (aka \u201cphase\u201d , \u201cbumper phase\u201d ,"}, {"chunk_id": 8, "text": "\u201cblip\u201d ) \u201cBunny Hop\u201d - Performing short jumps in quick succession allows you to move faster than walking speed. Performing bunnyhops also allows the player to reduce loss of momentum. (aka \u201cbunnyhop\u201d or \u201cbhop\u201d) \u201cCassette Boost\u201d - Jumping off of a cassette block within the first frame of it being active causes the jump to gain extra height. \u201cCassette Raise\u201d - Remaining inside a cassette block while it activates and deactivates causes it to move upwards by two pixels. This can be repeated indefinitely to move a cassette block upwards vertically, provided you have the means to remain inside the cassette block for the required time period. \u201cCassette Boosted Feather Super\u201d - This refers to a niche technique involving performing a jump using the momentum of exiting a feather while on an activating cassette block. Due to its specificity, it has very little application in gameplay. This tech is most often referred to humorously due to its convoluted abbreviation. This video showcases an example of this phenomenon. (aka \u201ccassoosted fuper\u201d) \u201cCeiling Pop\u201d - (aka \u201ccpop\u201d) When Madeline is at the bottom pixel of a wall, she can go under the wall and seemingly climbjump under the wall, hitting her head on the ceiling (hence why it\u2019s called a \u2018ceiling pop\u2019). This technique is extremely precise, requiring frame-perfect timing and extremely precise positio ning down to less than a pixel. (see also, \u2018frame perfect\u2019 and \u2018subpixels\u2019.) Cpops can also be performed off of spiked walls, requiring precision all the way down to a tenth of a pixel, referred to as \u201cspiked ceiling pops\u201d . \u201cCeiling Pop Cornerboost\u201d - (aka \u201cpopcorn\u201d) A tech combining ceiling pops and corner boosts. This is achieved by performing a ceiling pop with enough horizontal speed to get a corner boost under the block. [h] \u201cCeiling Pop Cornerboost Wallboost\u201d - (aka \u201cpopcornwob\u201d) A tech combining ceiling pops, corner boosts, and wallboosts. This is achieved by performing a ceiling pop cornerboost (see above), then switching directions to cancel horizontal speed with a wallboost. This can be used to jump under a block and grab onto the other side without dashing in highly specific situations. [i] \u201cChained Ultra\u201d - Performing several ultras in sequence will give Madeline an exponentially increasing speed boost. (aka \"Chultra\", \u201cChultras\u201d) \u201cClimb Boosting\u201d - This tech refers to gaining liftboost from a moving block that Madeline cannot grab. To do this, Madeline must do a wall jump from the block while holding grab. Holding grab allows Madeline to get the liftboost even when she cannot grab the block. [verify] \u201cClimbhop\u201d - Climbing onto the top of a platform causes Madeline to perform a small hop. \u201cClimbhop Cancel\u201d - Dashing during a climbhop on a moving object allows Madeline to retain the speed of the moving object into the dash, even if"}, {"chunk_id": 9, "text": "the dash is in a different direction to the block\u2019s movement . This has strange consequences, even including allowing the player to move through spikes under particular circumstances. [j] \u201cClimbhop Cancel Ceiling Pop Cornerboost Wallboost Delayed Ultra\u201d - (aka \u201cclobpopcornhob dultra\u201d) \ud83d\udc80 what the fuck \u201cClimbhop Entanglement\u201d - This niche technique allows the player to \u2018entangle\u2019 their momentum with a moving block without being in contact with that block. By canceling the animation Madeline does when climbing up to the top of a tile, which can be done (not exclusively) with a dash, then by resetting Madeline\u2019s forced x by jumping off of other walls in intervals of 12 frames or less [k] , or hitting springs in intervals of 18 frames or less, Madeline\u2019s momentum will remain \u2018entangled\u2019 with the block. This means that, as long as the block remains moving, its momentum will be applied to Madeline. If the block changes direction or stops moving, Madeline\u2019s momentum will also reflect this. [l] \u201cClimbjump\u201d (aka \u201cclimb jump\u201d) - While holding a wall, jumping while holding the direction towards the wall or upwards will result in a climbjump. This will consume 27.5 units of stamina, one quarter of Madeline\u2019s maximum stamina. \u201cCoffee Jump\u201d - A coffee jump is simply a corner jump performed off of a one tile overhang, starting from a wall. It is performed by pressing the jump button twice in rapid succession, more easily with two jump keys. It is called the coffee jump, as it is a required technique for the winged golden strawberry in the chapter 1 A-side, on the screen that has a caf\u00e9 in the background. \u201cCore Super\u201d / \u201cCore Hyper\u201d - Performing a Super or Hyper dash during a brief window as a core block is destroyed allows Madeline to super or hyper dash with the added momentum of the core block. \u201c Cornerboost \u201d (aka \u201c coost \u201d, \u201ccboost\u201d or \"cb\") - Climbjumping into the top corner of a tile with some momentum will give a small speed boost. The speed boost will only apply if Madeline inputs a jump prior to grabbing the wall. This is particularly useful as a means of canceling a dash and keeping the dash speed beyond the usual duration of the dash (like a Super Dash). Note that, although niche, a cornerboost can also be performed off of the bottom corner of a wall if the wall is moving vertically upwards with high enough speed, as this means that the wall will be above Madeline during the jump portion of the cornerboost meaning that she will avoid colliding with it . \u201cCornerboost Wallboost\u201d - A wallboost from a cornerboost. This entails performing a cornerboost with a neutral climbjump (without holding horizontally) and then holding away from the direction climb jumped. Notably, this can instantly remove high amounts of speed due to the properties of a wallboost. (aka \u201ccobwob\u201d, \u201cwoosted coost\u201d, \u201ccornerboosted wallboost\u201d)"}, {"chunk_id": 10, "text": "\u201cCornerslip\u201d - Coming within 1 pixel vertically of a platform without landing on the platform allows Madeline\u2019s dash to be refilled without resetting vertical speed. This is often (incorrectly) referred to as a \u2018jasig jump\u2019 as it often occurs when performing the speedrun strategy \u2018jasig\u2019. \u201cCorner Correction\u201d - A leniency mechanic in which jumping or dashing into the corner of a solid surface in a given direction causes Madeline to automatically move around the corner instead of getting stopped by it. For example, jumping or dashing upwards into a corner on a ceiling will cause Madeline to move around the corner as long as she is, at most, 4 pixels away from the corner and moving towards the ceiling, which makes techniques such as wallbouncing more lenient. \u201cCorner Jump\u201d (aka \u201ccjump\u201d) - Jumping off of the corner of a block will result in a wall jump. . (Sometimes it is referred to as \u201c cump \u201d, though this abbreviation is often avoided due to sounding suggestive.) \u201cCorner kick\u201d (aka \u201cckick\u201d)- Jumping into the corner of a block from underneath, then jumping again once the block is crossed, will allow Madeline to wall jump off of the corner. ( Corner Jumps and Corner Kicks are not to be confused. ) \u201cCoyote Time\u201d - Coyote time refers to the game allowing certain actions to be performed after they should technically no longer be possible. Jumping a few frames after walking off of a ledge will still result in a jump, for instance. Coyote time is responsible for making various other techniques possible, including dream hypers/supers and core supers/hypers. Like buffering, coyote time is a feature of various other games; in Celeste the window for coyote time is five frames. The mechanic\u2019s name is a reference to Wile E. Coyote, a character from Looney Tunes. \u201cDash\u201d - One of the basic actions the player can perform. By holding a direction and pressing Dash, the player can dash in one of eight directions. By default, Madeline can only do this once. Afterwards she must regain the dash by touching the ground, collecting a refill, interacting with an entity, or entering a screen transition. When Madeline has one dash, her hair is red; when she has no dashes, her hair is light blue, and when she has two dashes, her hair turns pink and floaty. \u201cDash Attack\u201d - A leniency mechanic wherein there is a 5 frame window [verify] after a dash ends in which dash-activated entities, such as dream blocks and kevin blocks, can still be activated. [m] \u201cDash Bounce\u201d - Dashing within 2 frames of inputting a wallbounce gives you a slight vertical bump when the dash ends. This is because the game applies a constant vertical speed to Madeline for 17 frames when doing a wall bounce, whereas Madeline\u2019s dash lasts for 15 frames. (aka \u201cdashbounce\u201d, \u201cdounce\u201d, or sometimes \u201cshaboingboing\u201d.) \u201cDash Redirection\u201d - When dashing, the game freezes for 3"}, {"chunk_id": 11, "text": "frames. During this period, [n] the player can change the direction of their dash. This is what allows crouch dashes to be performed manually, as when dashing dowards, Madeline crouches, and when redirecting a downwards dash into another direction, she stays crouched. \u201cDash Trigger\u201d - Missing Descriptor; include information on Dash Trigger Skip (DTS) [o] \u201cDelayed Block Boost\u201d - A block boost may still be performed if the player is no longer in contact with the block, instead wall jumping off of another surface within the nine-frame window of being in contact with the block. This phenomenon is rarely called a \u201cdelayed block boost\u201d, though sometimes it is just referred to as a block boost. This video showcases an example of this phenomenon. (aka \u2018momentum carry\u2019) [p] \u201cDelayed Ultra\u201d (aka \u201cdultra\u201d) - Canceling a diagonal down dash before the dash ends and before touching the floor gives Madeline the 1.2x speed boost from the ultra the next time she contacts the floor , essentially storing the speed boost to be used later. Canceling the dash can be achieved in several ways, including climbjumping during the dash or entering a feather. \u201cDemo Dash\u201d (aka \u201cdemo\u201d) - Crouching while dashing horizontally will preserve the crouched hitbox while dashing. This action can be mapped to a single input in the controls menu. This has a wide variety of implications, including allowing the player to squeeze through gaps they normally can\u2019t. Demos cannot be performed if the player is in air and crouching and will instead cause the player to uncrouch immediately, which also means that a demo dash cannot be buffered out of another demo dash like normal dashes can. (aka \u201ccrouch dash\u201d) \u201cDemo Hyper\u201d - Dashing diagonally downward, followed by a jump, will result in a hyper dash. However, the player can perform a hyper dash by demo dashing horizontally as well. This is called a \u2018demo hyper\u2019. Demo hypers have some additional utility compared to normal hypers; they can give more distance due to the dash extending slightly further, as well as allowing players to perform the technique in midair or on dream blocks, for instance. (see also, \u2018midair super\u2019). \u201cDeleting Madeline Safely\u201d - Missing Descriptor (??????) \u201cDouble Cornerboost \u201d (aka \u201cdcb\u201d) - Performing two cornerboosts on the same tile, often by using two jump buttons in quick succession. (not to be confused with \u2018Depths Cornerboost\u2019 [speedrunning trick, needs entry] , which also uses the acronym \u2018dcb\u2019) \u201cDream Boost\u201d (aka \u201cdroost\u201d) - When Madeline exits a dream block, the minuscule boost she gets from it is called a \u201cdream boost\u201d. This mechanic is most often referred to in the context of the niche \u2018splipped droost\u2019 technique. (see \u2018splipped droost\u2019) [q] \"Dream Double Jump\" - Pressing jump just before exiting a dream block,"}, {"chunk_id": 12, "text": "and again in the coyote time given from exiting a dream block will cause a jump that has more distance/height than a normal dream jump . This is because a jump adds 40 horizontal speed, so the second jump would both add another 40 speed on top of the first, as well as having slightly more height than a normal dream jump would. (aka \"ddj\") \u201cDream Grab\u201d - While exiting a dream block from a side, hold the grab button and the opposite direction of movement to cling onto the edge of the dream block. \u201cDream Grab Hyper\u201d - a player can perform a hyper out of a dream block within five frames of exiting the dream block, even if they perform a dream grab first. This is particularly useful with Theo (see \u2018theohyper\u2019). \u201cDream Hyper/Super\u201d - Inputting a hyper/super during the five-frame coyote time window given after exiting a dream block will give the height and distance of a hyper/super dash, but will consume the player\u2019s dash. (see also, \u2018coyote time\u2019) Dream hypers cannot be performed if the player enters the dream block crouched or vertically. (aka \u201cdryper\u201d) \u201cDream Jump\u201d - Press Jump while exiting the dream block to jump out of the dream block. This works in all directions. There are a total of 13 frames for this, 5 buffer frames, 3 freeze frames and then 5 coyote frames. (See also, \u2018Coyote Time\u2019.) You cannot Dream Jump if you enter the block vertically. \u201cDream Smuggle\u201d - By dashing into a dream block and grabbing an object right before entering it, Madeline can carry held objects while dashing through Dream Blocks. Although this technique is technically vanilla, it has no practical use. It has more prevalence in custom Celeste maps. (aka \u201csmuggle\u201d, \u201cdream smuggle\u201d) \u201cExtended Super/Hyper\u201d - Performing a super or hyper and waiting 10 frames before jumping will return Madeline\u2019s dash. \"Extended\" is sometimes shortened to \"ex\" or \"ext\". \u201cFailed Neutral\u201d - A term used to refer to jumping away from a wall and immediately steering back towards it without performing a neutral, which loses a small amount of height on the wall. This is generally only used to set up a consistent subpixel positioning for other techniques, such as demos. \u201cFast Bubble\u201d - Pressing Dash while in a bubble will cause the bubble to move in a direction sooner than usual. (aka \u201cfastbubble\u201d, or \"fubble\") \u201cFast Fall\u201d - While falling, holding down will make you fall much faster . Madeline\u2019s sprite appears to narrow while fastfalling . [r] \u201cFeather Bounce\u201d - This refers to when a player bounces off of a wall to change directions quickly, usually doing a 180 degree turn. \u201cFeather Clip\u201d - Using a feather against the top of a jump-through platform will allow Madeline to clip through the platform. You must be holding down against the jump through when the feather expires. [s] \u201cFeather Super\u201d - Jumping along a solid surface while in the feather state will result in a longer,"}, {"chunk_id": 13, "text": "faster jump akin to a Super Dash. (see also \u2018Super Dash\u2019) (aka \u201cfuper\u201d, more often used in \u2018cassoosted fuper\u2019). \u201c Forced x \u201d - This game mechanic temporarily forces a player to move in a specific direction for a certain number of frames. For example, a player is locked into moving right for 12 frames after performing a rightward wall jump. \u201cFrame Perfect\u201d - These are a category of maneuvers that can only be performed on one single frame. Frames are the smallest increment of time in a video game. Celeste runs at 60 Frames per second, so each frame is one sixtieth of a second. The format for abbreviating these maneuvers is the number of frames in which a maneuver can be executed, followed by F. So for one frame maneuvers, the abbreviation is 1F. (Not to be confused with F#, which indicates a flag or checkpoint. See \u2018Flag.\u2019 Also not to be confused with \u20182f\u2019, an April Fools map by Ellis Vesper which requires its own section under custom maps.) [t] \u201cFreeze Frame\u201d - While interacting with certain mechanics or performing certain actions, such as bubbles or bumpers, t he game will briefly stop . (aka \u201cFF\u201d.) \u201cGrabless Dream Hyper\u201d (aka Mickey Mouse?) Missing Descriptor \u201c Grounded Ultra\u201c - A down diagonal dash that collides with the ground before the dash ends. These can be chained by wavedashing out of the first down diagonal dash, then quickly dashing in the same direction again. Colliding with the ground out of the down diagonal dash will still provide a 1.2x speed boost, but the speed boost will not persist after the dash ends. This is the fastest method of travel across flat ground. (aka \"Gultra\", \u201cGultras\u201d ) \u201cGrounded Wallboost\u201d - A niche technique involving performing a wallbo st shortly before being grounded . This is done by grabbing a wall at the highest point [u] , doing a short hop neutral climbjump, holding towards the wall, and then wallboosting, usually followed by a coyote jump off the ground. Often, a cornerslip is performed after the wallboost to get the coyote jump from lower down. (aka \u201cgwoost\u201d.) \u201cHalf Stamina Climb\u201d - A technique done by doing neutral climb jump, followed by a wallboost and the a climbjump up to 2 frames after the wallb ost (sometimes must be 1f after due to subpixels). This results in a jump from the wall with less speed, since the climb jump acts as a reverse cornerboost, reducing speed by 40. Only the second of the two climbjumps uses up stamina (since the wallboost refunds the first climbjump\u2019s usage), hence the name. (More detail on where an nrcb is used may or may not be useful) [v] \u201cHeart Ultra\u201d - Dashing down diagonally at the exact moment Madeline bounces off a crystal heart allows her to collect it while maintaining the momentum of the bounce through the down diagonal dash. By spending Madeline\u2019s dash before attempting to perform this technique, making use of buffering, this technique can"}, {"chunk_id": 14, "text": "be performed more leniently. This technique is usually only performed for flavor, but is sometimes useful. This tech can also be used to collect a heart, then cancel the heart collect by entering a screen transition. (aka \u201chultra\u201d) \u201cHoldable Climbjump\u201d - Repeatedly neutral dropping a holdable object, climbjumping up the wall and picking up the object allows Madeline to scale a wall while still having the object. (aka \u201ctheo climb\u201d, \u201cjelly climb\u201d) \u201cHoldable Dash\u201d - Dashing while in a holdable storage state . This allows madeline to dash after a boost while seemingly holding a holdable, by releasing grab when getting the boost. (see \u2018Boost Holdable Storage\u2019. Note that this tech may also be called extra ball tech.) \u201cHoldable Lift\u201d - Throwing a held object at a wall, then dashing up into the object while holding Grab as it rebounds off of the wall, will allow the player to gain some height with a held object. It is most easily and effectively performed with jellyfish, but can be performed with heavy objects as well. (not to be confused with \u2018jellyvator\u2019, \u2018theovator\u2019, \u2018jelly regrab\u2019, or \u2018jelly ladder\u2019.) [w] \u201cHyper Bunny Hop\u201d - Performed by following up a hyper dash with a tiny jump, followed by a full jump, this technique allows Madeline to gain significantly more height and momentum than a hyper dash. (aka \u201chyper bunnyhop\u201d, \u201chyper bhop\u201d, or less commonly, \u201chbhop\u201d.) \u201cHyper Dash\u201d - Following a down-diagonal dash on the ground with a Jump will result in a high-speed, low-height jump. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to performing a dash. (aka \u201chyper\u201d) \u201cInstant Hyper\u201d - This tech refers to performing a hyper with little delay between the dash and the jump. \u201cInstant Super\u201d - This tech refers to performing a super with little delay between the dash and the jump. \u201cJelly Bump\u201d - Holding jump when grabbing a jellyfish at speed will cause the jellyfish to boost upwards, even when dashing downright or down into the jellyfish. [x] \u201cJelly Juggle\u201d - This does not refer to a particular technique, but when the player has multiple jellyfish around them and switches between them, it is called \u2018juggling\u2019. [y] \u201cJelly Ladder\u201d - Having upwards momentum while repeatedly grabbing and neutral dropping two jellyfish allows Madeline to infinitely gain height by exploiting the upward boost from grabbing a jellyfish. Slowfalling makes this tech more lenient to perform. \u201cJelly Neutrals\u201d - Repeatedly neutral dropping a jelly, neutral jumping off the wall and picking up the jelly allows Madeline to ascend a wall while retaining a jelly and not using stamina (see \u2018Neutral jumps\u2019). Note that you can also do this by gliding back to the wall using the jelly, but that requires a lot more horizontal space than is often available. This"}, {"chunk_id": 15, "text": "is not to be confused with holdable climbjumping . \u201cJelly Regrab\u201d - Throwing a Jellyfish while in midair, then immediately diagonal dashing back into it, will allow you to gain some extra height and distance from the jellyfish. Regrabbing a jellyfish can be performed horizontally, as well, if starting from a neutral drop. If done vertically, it is instead called \u2018jellyvator\u2019. Regrabs can also be performed on heavier objects, such as Theo\u2019s crystal, but this is much more difficult and sometimes requires the player to dash more than once to catch the object. \u201cJellyvator\u201d - Neutral dropping from a jellyfish then dashing up into the jellyfish while holding Grab allows the player to gain some height while holding the jellyfish. This technique is similar to \u2018holdable lift\u2019, but does not require a nearby wall to perform the technique. When done with a heavier object, such as Theo\u2019s crystal, it is called \u201ctheovator\u201d. (not to be confused with \u2018jelly regrab\u2019 or \u2018holdable lift\u2019.) \u201cKermit Dash\u201d - Missing Descriptor \u201cKoral Skip \u201d - When Madeline is pushed against the border of a screen by certain entities, including Kevins or zip movers, Madeline will \u2018teleport\u2019 to the other side of the entity. This is called Koral Skip, I think, for some reason. Need verification . [z] \u201cLaunch Dash Redirect\u201d - Missing Descriptor \u201cLava Neutral\u201d - The player can neutral off of lava and ice with frame perfect timing. [aa] \u201cLava Wall Jump\u201d - The player can also walljump off of lava with frame perfect timing. \u201cLiftboost\u201d - This is a game mechanic that applies the speed of a moving block onto Madeline. There is a nine -frame window where Madeline can gain a boost in momentum from a moving block, even after she is no longer touching the block or if the block stops moving. (Not to be confused with \u2018block boost\u2019, a technique that utilizes the mechanic liftboost.) \u201cLow Speed Ultra\u201d - When you start a down diagonal dash toward the ground, too high to initiate a wavedash, then jump with the slight extra speed of that dash. This is normally an ultra, but if performed with no initial speed boost, this ultra will result in a minimal gain in speed, which cannot be used to chain speed boosts. (see the buffering section in \u2018 Ultras and You \u2019 ). (These may also be referred to as a \u201c Failed Wavedash\u201d . This term is rarely used, due to its misleading or confusing name, given that there are several ways to \"fail\" a wavedash. (aka \u201cfyper\u201d, \u201cfailed hyper\u201d or \u201ccarwash\u201d) [ab] \u201cMidair Hyper\u201d - Starting in midair, demo dashing while level with some ground and jumping when reaching that ground will have Madeline perform a hyper dash. To avoid confusing these with wavedashes, they are often called \u201cmidair demo hypers\u201d or simply \u201cdemo hypers\u201d."}, {"chunk_id": 16, "text": "(see also \u2018demo hyper\u2019, and \u2018wavedash\u2019.) \u201cMidair Super\u201d - Starting in midair, dashing while level with some ground and jumping when reaching that ground will have Madeline perform a super dash. \u201cMoonboost\u201d - Performing a super dash or demo hyper into the top three pixels of a moon block will push the moon block while simultaneously correcting the player to be on top of the moon block due to corner correction, resulting in a speed boost not possible on normal terrain. (See also, \u2018moon block\u2019 and \u2018corner correction\u2019.) (aka \u201cmoost\u201d) \u201cMultiboost\u201d - A technique where multiple boosts are gained from a block in quick succession, possible because of the properties of liftboost. There are many different ways to gain multiple block boosts, but the most common and easiest is to jump from a moving block and then immediately dash down-diagonally. (aka \u201cdbb\u201d for \u2018double block boost\u2019.) \u201cNeutral Drop\u201d - Holding Down and letting go of Grab while holding an object will cause Madeline to drop whatever she is holding in place instead of flinging it in the direction she is facing. \u201cNeutral Jump\u201d - Jumping from a wall while holding no direction will not consume any stamina , and will push Madeline a very short distance from the wall. This is useful, as you can then press back towards the direction of the wall to perform another neutral jump. This allows you to scale walls without grabbing the wall or consuming stamina. (aka \u201cneutrals\u201d, \u201cneutral climb\u201d, or \u201cneutral wall jump\u201d.) \u201cNeutral Reverse Cornerboost\u201d - A reverse cornerboost, but with a neutral climbjump (you release horizontal inputs before climbjumping ) This means that you do not lose the 40 speed you usually do, so usually are more efficient for speed if followed by another dash. However, since the climbjump is neutral, there is the possibility of wallbosting afterwards, which sets your speed to a constant. To avoid this, you should dash before holding downleft, and then change to holding downleft in freeze frames (to redirect the dash) (aka \u201cnrcb\u201d) \"Overclocking\" - This refers to any tech that results in Madeline receiving more stamina than her normal maximum using a wallboost. Most commonly this is done by performing a wallboost while in contact with the ground. Because the player is starting from the ground, stamina is not consumed by the action , however, the stamina refund is still applied, giving Madeline extra stamina. This is just one example; this tech can be performed by resetting Madeline\u2019s stamina in any way in the middle of a wallboost. (see also \u201cwallboost\u201d.) (Not to be confused with \u201cgrounded wallbost\u201d) \u201cOverhangs\u201d - A dashless tech which is performed when Madeline jumps from one wall and jumps onto the same wall but bulged by a few tiles. The easiest overhangs are 1-3 tile overhangs, which are very lenient and quite easy to pull off. However, 4tiles, 5tiles, and 6tiles require much"}, {"chunk_id": 17, "text": "more precise and difficult moves to pull off.. There are also a couple of niche overhangs, including 3x2 which is when Madeline has to jump 3 tiles horizontally and 2 tiles vertically, and a 2x1 which is 2 tiles horizontally and 1 tile vertically. \u201cPerfect Cornerjump\u201d (aka \u201cpcj\u201d, sometimes referred to jokingly as \u201c penis cock jump \u201d) Missing Descriptor [ac] [ad] [ae] [af] \u201cPuffer Boost\u201d - Similar to \u2018Bumper Boost\u2019, this technique involves holding the direction away from a pufferfish as it explodes to gain more speed and distance. Holding the direction towards the pufferfish has the opposite effect. (aka \u201cFish Boost\u201d, \u201cFoost\u201d) \"Reform Tech\" - Blocks that break and respawn (Move Blocks, Core Blocks etc.) respawn initially without their spikes and the spikes load in shortly after. This gives a brief window of time to land on the top of the block. \u201cRetention Tech\u201d - Entering a booster in a particular way (specific details needed) puts Madeline in a strange state where the game thinks she\u2019s inside the bubble, while Madeline is still moving outside of the bubble. This allows the player to fire the bubble, immediately snapping Madeline back inside of the bubble. [ag] \"Reverse Cornerboost\" - P erforming an up-diagonal dash from underneath a bottom corner of a wall with high speed, and then turning around and climbjumping off of the wall cancels the dash and allows the dash momentum to be retained into the climbjump . \u201cReverse Super\u201d, \u201cReverse Hyper\u201d or \u201cReverse Wavedash\u201d - While performing a super, hyper, or wavedash, jumping in the opposite horizontal direction to the dash causes the resulting speed to be given in the opposite direction to normal. As with a regular super/hyper/wavedash, if Madeline is in contact with the floor on or after the 10th frame of the dash, she will retain her dash, which is called 'extending'. This technique is typically used to extend a super/hyper/wavedash off a small platform against a wall, where it would normally not be possible to. Reverse is sometimes shortened to \u2018rev\u2019. \u201cRoboboost\u201d - An extremely complicated TAS-only speedrun technique. Needs elaboration . [ah] [ai] [aj] [ak] [al] \u201cScreen Transition Cassette Offset\u201d - Using a screen transition as a cassette block activates causes all cassette blocks of that color in the new screen to be one pixel higher, and all cassette blocks of the previous color to be one pixel lower . This video showcases an example of this phenomenon. \u201cSeeker Boost\u201d - Similarly to a bumper boost or puffer boost, holding the direction away from a seeker at the moment it respawns will propel Madeline away from the seeker at a much higher speed and distance. Due to the difficulty in execution, this technique is seldom used. (See also, \u2018bumper boost\u2019) \u201cShoryuken\u201d - [am] \"Slow Fall\" - While holding the jump button as Madeline is in a jump"}, {"chunk_id": 18, "text": "arc, Madeline\u2019s descent will be slightly slowed down until she reaches maximum falling velocity. Unlike Fast Falling, this technique is very difficult to discern from regular falling, as the difference is so small and there is no physical change in Madeline\u2019s sprite. [Verify] [an] [ao] \u201cSnake Ultra\u201d - This refers to an ultra that can be performed with superdash by having the player dash downright, shift down, then downright, then right, or vice versa. This gives the player high speed and results in an S-shaped dash pattern (aka \u201csnultra\u201d. Some people mistakenly believe that this tech is called a \u201csnail ultra\u201d.) \u201cSpike d Climb\u201d - I f Madeline maintains low speed away from a spiked wall, she can remain within a 2 pixel distance away from it, and therefore still able to jump off the wall (due to wall jump leniency) without the dying to the spikes since she has speed moving in the direction that they face. Spike climbs in which Madeline moves a significant distance up the wall are sometimes TAS-only. An example of a spike climb can be found here , though not all spike climbs are as long as this. (aka \u201cspike climb\u201d, \u201csplimb\u201d) \u201cSpike Clip\u201d If Madeline is moving downwards at a high enough velocity [ap] towards spikes with no tile beneath them, Madeline may move through the spike without dying. The way that she does this is by having the bottom pixel of her hurtbox go from above the spike hitbox to below it in 1 frame, essentially frame skipping the spike. The reason this happens is because the developers made it so that the bottom pixel is the only pixel that needs to be touching the spike in order for madeline to get killed. (aka \u201cspikeclip\u201d, this tech is sometimes also called \u201cspikefall\u201d or \u201cspike fall\u201d, but this term can also refer to a setup to perform a spike clip.) \u201cSpike Clipped Dream Boost\u201d - When there are spikes surrounding a dream block and Madeline does a perfect dash towards a corner, it\u2019s possible for Madeline to seemingly clip through the spikes and get the boost from the dream block despite there being no area for Madeline to touch the dream block. Due to its precision and limited application, it is rarely used in custom maps. This tech is most often referred to as a joke. (aka \u201cSplipped Droost\u201d.) \u201cSpike Jump\u201d - When an external object, such as wind or zip movers, pushes Madeline into spikes or pushes spikes into Madeline while Madeline has speed away from the spikes, there is a brief window of time where she can jump off the wall behind the spikes due to the order in which Celeste handles operations. (Not to be confused with Corner Jumps, Corner Kicks or 5 /6 Jumps) \u201cSpiked Cornerboost\u201d - A spiked cornerboost is a precise cornerboost on a spike-covered tile performed by positioning Madeline just above the spike hitbox, but low enough to perform a wall jump from the tile. \u201cSpiked Wallbounce\u201d - Madeline can perform a wallbounce off of a spiked tile if the"}, {"chunk_id": 19, "text": "jump is performed during the three frames of leniency after the 15 normal frames of dash (see also, \u2018dash attack\u2019) and if the player holds in the same direction that the spikes are facing. [aq] [ar] \u201cSpinner Stun\u201d - This is a difficult technique that exploits the system. By unpausing and pausing on consecutive frames, the player can prevent the spinners\u2019 hitboxes from loading, allowing Madeline to pass through them. By beginning the process of loading in a group of spinners (each screen has three spinner groups) while Madeline is near enough to them to load, and pausing constantly, allowing the game to only run unpaused for one or two frames at a time, the spinners will remain unloaded. (aka \u201cstun\u201d) \u201cSpinner Unload\u201d - Spinner Unloads refer to a variety of tech that involve unloading the spinners on a screen in some way. There are many ways to do this. The most common way is to move so that the spinners are no longer on screen. If the player can somehow move offscreen, the spinners will be unloaded and Madeline can safely move through them. This can be achieved by having high enough speed that the spinners don\u2019t have enough time to load when they come onscreen or that Madeline herself is offscreen. This can also be achieved with a glitch that involves waiting 119 hours (need exact amount of time) for two thirds of the spinners in a room to unload. [as] \"Spring Cancel\" - Dashing quickly after hitting a spring cancels the momentum from the spring. (aka \"sprancel\") \u201cSquish Refill\u201d - Missing Descriptor \u201cStamina\u201d - Stamina is a stat istic which depletes when Madeline either climbs up a wall, hangs onto a wall or performs a climbjump. Madeline\u2019s maximum stamina is 110 units. When she runs out of stamina, she will no longer be able to grab walls. Madeline\u2019s sprite will begin to flash red when she has below 20 units of stamina, at which point she will be able to continue holding a wall until she runs out of stamina but cannot grab another wall. She may still climbjump. Madeline will instantly regain stamina by touching the ground, interacting with an entity, collecting a refill, or entering a screen transition. Note that climbing down a wall does not deplete stamina. \u201cStamina Canceling\u201d - When climbing a wall, holding up and tapping grab repeatedly instead of simply holding up and grab. When done correctly, this uses less stamina than climbing the wall normally. \u201cSubpixels\u201d - Madeline's position, as well as some other entities such as the Theo Crystal and Seekers, are saved as a Float (decimal) value. [au] This means that despite their positions only being shown as occupying a certain set of pixels, their position is actually significantly more precise than that. This subpixel position can be manipulated by performing certain actions, such as dashing into a wall, landing on the ground, or climbjumping into a ceiling. Occasionally, when needing to fall into a pixel perfect gap for example, Madeline's subpixel position may sometimes prevent her from getting to the needed pixel by just holding in that direction, which"}, {"chunk_id": 20, "text": "is due to movement speed being a decimal number of pixels per frame. \u201cSuperdash\u201d - A mechanic that appears in the \u2018variants\u2019 menu wherein Madeline is given a longer dash which can be course-corrected. Some custom maps can have this mechanic set by default for a unique challenge. (Not to be confused with \u2018Super Dash\u2019.) \u201cSuper Dash\u201d (usually just \u201csuper\u201d) - Following a horizontal Dash on the ground with a Jump will allow Madeline to perform a longer and faster jump with the same height as a normal jump. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to performing a dash. (Not to be confused with \u2018Superdash\u2019.) \u201cSuperwave\u201d - An extended super dash quickly followed by a reverse wavedash. Usually performed on crumble platforms and pink clouds. \u201cTheo Stall\u201d - \u201cThrowable Dream Hyper\u201d - A dream hyper done while holding a throwable. To perform this tech, you must perform a dream grab and then a dream hyper in quick succession after leaving a dream block. If you do not dream grab, the throwable is dropped/thrown upon leaving the dream block. (aka \u201ctheo dryper\u201d, \u201ctheo dream hyper\u201d) \u201cUltra\u201d - Colliding with the ground from a down diagonal dash will give Madeline a 1.2x speed boost, and, if this collision happens after the dash ends, allow preservation of that speed. A jump is often used after this to preserve speed and gain more distance. For further detail, see the Ultras and You doc. This is sometimes called an \"Ultra Dash\", but that term is inaccurate, as there are several parts to an ultra apart from the dash. (aka \u201cUltras\u201d.) (That said, because of how ultras are introduced and nuance with getting the 1.2x speed multiplier may lead to people having inconsistent definitions of ultras and related terms.) \u201cUndemo\u201d - a niche tech allowing the first frame of a down or down diagonal dash to be done without crouch. It is performed by starting a regular dash that is not down or down diagonal and then redirecting to down or down diagonal (the inverse of a manual demo). \u201c Wallboost\u201d - Doing a neutral climbjump then holding away from the wall within 11 frames will refund the stamina consumed by the move and instantly sets speed to 130 in the direction opposite of the wall. (aka \u201cwoost\u201d) (not to be confused with \u201cwallbounce.\u201d) \u201cWallbounce\u201d - Dashing up and pressing Jump near a wall allows you to jump very high off of the wall. This technique is introduced in chapter 7B in vanilla Celeste. (aka \"wounce\" or \u201cwbounce\u201d, not to be confused with \u201cwallboost\u201d.) \u201cWall Jump\u201d - If Madeline is right next to a wall, she can do a wall jump away from the wall, or in the neutral direction. Doing this in the neutral direction is called a \u2018neutral jump\u2019. If Madeline jumps in the direction towards the wall while holding the wall, she will consume some stamina and jump in the direction towards the wall , which is called a \u2018"}, {"chunk_id": 21, "text": "climbjump \u2019. If she is not holding the wall but attempts any wall jump other than a neutral jump, she will jump away from the wall instead. This is often the result of running out of stamina. (see also, \u2018neutral jump\u2019 and \u2018climb jump\u2019.) \u201cWater Boost\u201d - When near the top of a pool of water, Madeline can jump and if moving in a direction her jump grants the normal +40 speed boost. This can be performed every frame until Madeline is out of the water allowing the ability to get 200+ speed then any prior speed entering the water. Although this technique is not TAS-only, TAS bots can perform this technique more proficiently than human players. \u201cWavedash\u201d - Starting in midair, dashing towards the ground and jumping just before hitting the ground will give Madeline her dash back and propel her forward, similarly to an extended hyper. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to a dash. This technique is introduced and used extensively in Farewell. \u201cWrap Hyper\u201d - This refers to when the player performs a dream hyper out of a dream block that they entered while crouched by performing a dream grab to uncrouch then inputting a hyper during coyote frames. It is very similar to performing a standard dream grab hyper, without theo, and done to uncrouch. It does not work diagonally. It is called this because Bred was eating a wrap when she decided to name it. Yup. \u201cYump\u201d - Missing Descriptor Custom Maps [av] Custom maps are maps created by the Celeste community to be played and enjoyed. Below is a list of some of the most historically important and highly regarded custom Celeste maps that exist, but it must be noted that this list is incomplete due to the sheer increasing number of existing custom Celeste maps. We can add a resource to find more Celeste maps here too; I\u2019m thinking gamebanana or one of the more reputable map lists that exists. \u201cStrawberry Jam Collab\u201d - a large mod released in 2023, currently the largest Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSJ2023\u201d, \u201cSJ2021\u201d, \u201cStrawberry Jam\u201d, or \"SJ\".) Below is a list of maps from Strawberry Jam, arranged in roughly ascending difficulty: SJ Beginner Lobby \u201cForest Path\u201d - a green beginner map which takes place in a dark forest. The map utilizes dream refills, which allow you to dash through normal blocks as if they were a dream block. This is the easiest map in strawberry jam, and is a likely first map in strawberry jam. \u201cAzure Caverns\u201d - a green beginner map taking place in a lush cave filled with boiling hot water. This map utilizes traffic blocks that only activate upon dashing into it, similar to a Kevin block. \u201cLoopy Lagoon\u201d - a green beginner map which takes place in an ocean of milk. The map is built around the mechanic of the giant cereal flakes, which resemble square Froot Loops. These cereal flakes have unique properties which bounce Madeline depending on how she interacts with them. \u201cCollapsing Skyline\u201d - a green beginner map which takes place in a"}, {"chunk_id": 22, "text": "collapsing and ruined city filled with skyscrapers. This map utilizes dash blocks from mirror temple and falling blocks to create a simple but uneasy platforming challenge. \u201cSeeing is Believing\u201d - a green beginner map which is famous for its unique gameplay. This map features extremely easy gameplay, however you must do it without seeing. The intended way to play is to play blindfolded as a friend guides you through the map. However, most people do not have friends, so this map includes an alternative route where the room is completely darkened, with Badeline guiding the player through instead. \u201cIf my \u2018driveway\u2019 almost did you in\u2026\u201d - a yellow beginner map which takes place in the same area as the prologue in vanilla celeste. The map is a reference to the prologue, where Madeline walks under a falling block. When she tells granny this, she laughs at Madeline and says, \u201cif my \u2018driveway\u2019 almost did you in, the Mountain might be a bit much for you,\u201d hence the name of the map. This entity, used only for this interaction in the vanilla game, is explored more thoroughly by this map. (aka \u201cdriveway\u201d) \u201cCassette Cliffs\u201d - a yellow beginner map that takes place at the top of a giant rainforest. This map uses cassette blocks, cassette traffic blocks, and other types of cassette blocks there are, hence why it\u2019s called \u201ccassette cliffs\u201d. (aka \u201cccliffs\u201d) \u201cOver the City\u201d - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a city at night. This somewhat lengthy and winding map disables Madeline\u2019s dash so it may focus solely on the jump crystal mechanic. (aka \u201cotc\u201d) \u201cTroposphere\u201d - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a dream set above the mountain. This map is a somewhat simple platforming puzzle focusing on Badeline boosts and dream blocks. \u201cPotential for Anything\u201d A yellow beginner map which utilizes gravity inversion mechanics. This map is a reference to the video game VVVVVV. \u201cMidnight Spire\u201d - A yellow beginner map that takes place in a blue tower. The background implies that the map also takes place in a mountainous region with a giant lake in the center. This map\u2019s platforming is somewhat tight and restrictive, but fairly easy. \u201cpaint\u201d - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a colorful and lively village. This map places emphasis on its story, as Madeline struggles with a work of art that she believes is not good enough and struggles to make it perfect; meanwhile, Badeline attempts to act as a voice of reason and urges her to take better care of herself. The map\u2019s platforming relies on more traditional game mechanics of moving platforms and dodging projectiles, set in time with the map\u2019s music. Due to the map\u2019s high-effort presentation, it is widely regarded to be the most iconic map in all of Strawberry Jam. \u201cRose Garden\u201d - A yellow beginner map which takes heavy inspiration from Super Mario Galaxy, particularly the gusty garden galaxy. The map\u2019s main mechanic, a holdable rose which acts as a parachute, giving Madeline an"}, {"chunk_id": 23, "text": "upwards boost whenever she presses the dash button, is also an idea borrowed from Super Mario Galaxy. \u201cTreehive\u201d - A yellow beginner map themed around a large beehive inside of a tree. The map\u2019s main mechanic is a particular variant of dream blocks, sometimes refered to as \u201choney blocks\u201d, which allow Madeline to reflect off of walls while inside, instead of dying when colliding with a wall. \u201cThe Squeeze\u201d - a yellow beginner map taking place in a dismal city. The map challenges the player to use the level geometry to line Madeline up to fall into several tight gaps. \u201cSoap\u201d - A red beginner map that takes place in a blue, bubbly environment. The main mechanics of this map are blue variants of entities found in the vanilla game, such as bubbles and springs, which, in their blue form, do not replenish Madeline\u2019s dash. This encourages the player to think twice about when and where to use their limited dashes. \u201cSwitchtube Vista\u201d - A red beginner map that takes place in a purple, retro city. Its main mechanics are pipes which function similarly to warp pipes from the Super Mario franchise, and switch blocks which toggle certain portions of the level between being on and off. The map is highly evocative of retro games from the NES era, as its mechanics, presentation, and music all appear to draw inspiration from retro Nintendo games. \u201cA Gift From the Stars\u201d - a red beginner puzzle map taking place in a forest at a UFO crash site. This map explores time-stopping mechanics to create infamously challenging puzzles. (aka \u201cagfts\u201d) \u201cStrawberry Orchard\u201d - A red beginner map that takes place on a ranch, as Madeline cartoonishly endeavors to steal a jar of the ranch\u2019s famous strawberry jam. This map primarily utilizes pipes, as well as a heavy throwable jar of jam that the player must navigate to the end of each screen. This map is considered to have the most challenging platforming of the beginner lobby. (aka \u201corchard\u201d) \u201c Dropzle \u201d - a red beginner puzzle map in which the player must use their finite number of dashes to align a series of Kevins in such a way that allows her to drop through a pixel perfect gap, hence \u2018 dropzle \u2019. Although it is possible, albeit challenging for most, to jump straight through the gap, it is discouraged by the map creator to do so. (Sometimes the term \u201cdropzle\u201d is also used to refer to pixel perfect gaps, in reference to this map.) \u201cCoresaken City\u201d - a red beginner map combining decoration and mechanics of Chapter 1, Forsaken City, and Chapter 8, Core. \u201cBlueberry Bay\u201d - the final challenge of the beginner lobby, Blueberry Bay is a beach-themed heartside with one flag dedicated to each of the maps in the beginner lobby. SJ Intermediate Lobby \u201cSleeping Under Stars\u201d - a green intermediate map similar to Farewell in design but utilizes low gravity throughout the map. \u201cFrosted Fragments\u201d - a green intermediate map that takes place in a frigid cave. It\u2019s main mechanics are blocks that the player can push to get further"}, {"chunk_id": 24, "text": "through the level or to obtain double dash refills and green boosters. \u201cFifth Dimension\u201d - a green intermediate map that is defaulted to two dashes, makes use of boosters that don\u2019t refill the player\u2019s dash, and uses wallbounces as its primary technique. \u201cLow-G Botany\u201d - missing description \u201cSpring Collab 2020\u201d - a large mod released in 2020. Prior to Strawberry Jam Collab, this was the largest and most well known Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSC2020\u201d, \u201cSpring Collab\u201d, or \u201cSC\u201d.) Keep in mind that standards for difficulty have increased since the map\u2019s release.

The map includes many easter eggs, including the humorous character Jash, complete with an Undertale-style boss battle, as well as hidden maps accessible only through solving an ARG. Gamation uploaded a YouTube Video covering this ARG. \"Monika's D-Sides Pack\" - One of the oldest campaign mods in Celeste, the full name being \"The D-Side Pack IV, the Resolutive Dance of Madeline and Monika\". These maps are based on the Vanilla chapters 1 - 9. They are often abbreviated as [Chapter Number]D (e.g. \"2D\" for Old Site D-Side), but are sometimes also abbreviated with an \"M\" in front to denote \"Monika's\" due to other mappers making their own D-Side packs (e.g. \"M5D\" for Mirror Temple D-Side). Final Goodbye, sometimes referred to as 9D, has Golden Strawberries that are collected by doing several consecutive checkpoints deathless, and a Platinum Strawberry for completing the whole map deathless. \u201cFore\u201d - a map by Scraggly1 combining Farewell and Core.

These maps consist of several extremely short, input-dense rooms which necessitate the use of retention tech to complete. The B-side is listed as a 2* on hardlist; the A-side and B-side used to both be required, but it was updated to only require the B-side since the A-side does not meet the standard of a 1*.

This map intends precise \u201chalf stamina climbs\u201d which used to be considered \u2018TAS only\u2019 before multiple people discovered they can be made easier using keybinds (though also viable without) . Ironically, the map is technically possible without the use of any half stamina climbs at all. \"Vivid Abyss\" - A high grandmaster map made by ABuffZucchini. It explores the interactions between some vanilla entities (dream blocks, clouds, kevins and later zi movers and dash blocks) with a large amount of grandmaster tech too. It has a moonbery checkpoint containing rooms inspired by other maps. This full clear of this map is a 1* on hardlist.

The initial version of the map was one of the most notoriously difficult maps for its time. Later on, fishtank created a version that was nerfed in difficulty, removing many of the buffs and turning it from a GM+1 map to an Expert map harder than 7D.

These maps are both designed as extremely tight corridors lined with hazards that require the player to use precise tech to traverse. CPVL is designed horizontally, with the player moving rightwards, while LXVI is designed vertically, with the player moving upwards. The naming convention for these maps follows a pattern of two letters in a word being replaced with another random letter. \u2018moce\u2019 is nice, \u2018cpvl\u2019 is cave, and \u2018lxvi\u2019 is love. CPVL used to be called \u201cCPCL\u201d, which stood for cock , spelling out nice// cock . This change was made due to issyy wanting //MOCE// to be a serious campaign, and the joke name CPCL did not suit this tone. \"Shatter Site\" - a dashless map made by AstralightSky . This map is infamous for its gameplay, being unplaytested and requiring numerous precise techniques to complete. The map\u2019s setting is a variant on Chapter 2, Old Site.

This is the final map in the \u201cMadeline votes in the 2020 US Presidential Election\u201d map pack, but is separate from the rest of the maps.

Formerly the most difficult room cleared in Celeste. \u201cDashless+\u201d - A buffed version of Chapter 1A, Forsaken City, which continues after the Forsaken City section into an original creation. It is a 3* map on Hardlist, (see also, \u2018hardlist\u2019,) and is currently considered the hardest custom map to ever be cleared. (aka \u201cD+\u201d).

Difficulty rises as the tier number descends, where Tier 0 is currently the hardest achieved golden. Farewell Golden serves as the bottom of Tier 3, and tiers 0-3 are also ranked by subcategories designated by the cell fill saturation.

Community References Below"}, {"chunk_id": 38, "text": "is a list of references and inside jokes frequently used by the Celeste community. \u201c1170\u201d - An infamous death that circled around the celeste community for a while. This death features celeste player \u201cShye\u201d playing 2k3 [requires its own section, possibly under D1D7] in celeste map \u2018D1D7\u2019 (see also, \u2018D1D7\u2019) before passing the hardest gap at the end and not pushing any buttons to move into the final gap. This death is a meme due to the immense discord posts showcasing the death as a reaction. \u201cBonk\u201d - community term for when Madeline hits her head on an object, usually after a wall bounce. is used frequently outside of the Celeste community as well. \u201cBurgy\u201d - A cross between Kirby and a burger, which is a common emote in the Celeste Community, and often seen as a mascot. ( if anyone knows the origins feel free to add that [bc] ) \u201cCarwash\u201d - Sometimes used to refer to wavedashes or failed wavedashes, this term comes from the mod Celeste, Google Translated Edition where, during the wavedash tutorial presentation, the text \u201cWith Wavedashing, you can jump very far and regain your dash at the same time! \u201d is replaced with \u201c Carwash allows you to go through windows simultaneously.\u201d \u201cComf\u201d - short for \u2018comfy,\u2019 this is a community term for when Madeline crouches in a one-block high gap. \u201cFrogeline\u201d - One of the many emotes used in the Celeste Discord server, this emote is often used to celebrate or congratulate other users\u2019 accomplishments. It depicts Madeline as a frog with a gaping mouth. \u201cHell Trio\u201d - A community term for three golden strawberries in celeste, 6bg, 7bg, and 8bg, which were each considered collectively as the hardest challenges in the game prior to the release of the Chapter 9 update, when the Farewell golden strawberry became Celeste\u2019s pen ultimate challenge. These serve as the baseline for custom modded map goldens/silvers to be on the Hard Golden List. Disorganized and Miscellaneous Entries Any entries that have not yet been sorted or cannot be sorted into a specific category will go here. \u201c0 framed\u201d - (aka \u201c0f\u201d) A phenomenon which can happen due to the way Celeste calculates the position of a moving entity at any given moment. All movement in the game is tied to frames, and Celeste has a default frame rate of 60 frames per second. From one frame to another, the player\u2019s position, for example, is calculated to have been moved by a certain number of pixels, and they are never considered to be present in between those positions. This makes it possible to clip through hazards without interacting with them at high enough speeds, as there are zero frames where the hazard can interact with Madeline. An example of this phenomenon is hitting a spiked Kevin using a green booster. This also makes certain actions impossible at high speeds, since there are no frames where the player is in the correct position to perform said action. \u201cCollab\u201d - Collabs are packs of maps made by several map creators."}, {"chunk_id": 39, "text": "(Collabs are all independent projects. Other similarly named collabs are not necessarily affiliated with one another. For example, Winter Collab 2021 is not affiliated with Spring Collab 2020.) \u201c Strawberry Jam Collab\u201d - A large mod released in 2023. (aka \u201cStrawberry Jam\u201d, \u201cSJ2023\u201d, or \"SJ\".) (Anything specifically associated with Strawberry Jam Collab will be given red text.) (See Custom Maps section below for more information!) \u201c Spring Collab 2020\u201d - A large mod released in 2020. Prior to Strawberry Jam Collab, this was the largest and most well known Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSC2020\u201d, \u201cSpring Collab\u201d, or \u201cSC\u201d.) (Anything specifically associated with Spring Collab 2020 will be given green text.) (See Custom Maps section below for more information!) \u201cSilver Strawberry\u201d - These are essentially the same as a golden strawberry, as they are obtained from completing the map without dying. They are often used in maps in collabs, as they represent that maps in collabs are often shorter than an average map. Similarly to goldens, silver strawberries are abbreviated with an \"S\" at the end, for example, Treehive Silver would be \"TreehiveS\". (aka \u201csilver\u201d) \u201cRainbow Strawberry\u201d - Spoilers for Spring Collab, Strawberry Jam, and other collabs and contests. These are obtained in certain collabs and/or contests, including Spring Collab and Strawberry Jam Collab, as a reward for collecting every silver strawberry in a lobby. \"Speed Berry\" - Appearing as a yellow strawberry with a clock, this strawberry serves as a speedrunning challenge for players. Speed Berries have bronze, silver, and gold times, which require increasingly optimized completions of the map. These appear in Spring Collab 2020 and a few other collabs. \"Alternate Sides\" - It is common for maps to indicate that they are simply a harder version of another map by following it with a letter, followed by the word \u201cside.\u201d This is an expansion of the B-Side and C-Side system of the vanilla game. This is most commonly done with D-Sides. \u201cDifficulty\u201d - Maps are generally categorized by difficulty. The five main difficulties are \u201cbeginner\u201d , \u201cintermediate\u201d , \u201cadvanced\u201d , \u201cexpert\u201d , and \u201cgrandmaster\u201d . (These are often abbreviated in order as beg/bg, int, adv, ex/exp, and gm) This difficulty delineation was popularized by Spring Collab 2020 and is the most widely used, including in Strawberry Jam. The difficulties, in comparison to vanilla Celeste, are as follows: - Beginner : The same as most of the game\u2019s main story chapters (A-sides). - Intermediate : Most of the game\u2019s B-sides and C-sides fall in this category. - Advanced : Some of Celeste\u2019s most difficult rooms reach low advanced territory. - Expert : Expert is beyond the difficulty of anything in vanilla Celeste. - Grandmaster : Grandmaster is also well beyond the difficulty of anything in vanilla. In addition, c olors are"}, {"chunk_id": 40, "text": "used to denote the difficulties of maps found in these categories, green being the least difficult, yellow being in the middle, and red being the most difficult, indicated by an image of a meter. Additionally, maps that are notably harder than even the hardest GM maps are often referred to as GM+, and a cracked meter is used to represent these maps in collabs (see \u2018Cracked\u2019). \"Celestial\" - The term \u201cCelestial\u201d is a suggested alternative to the gm+x format to indicate maps which are harder than grandmaster, but it is not widely used by the Celeste community. \u201cCracked\u201d - Sometimes \u201ccracked red\u201d, these refer to maps given cracked difficulty, used in grandmaster maps to indicate maps that are beyond the typical spectrum of grandmaster difficulty. These maps are sometimes referred to as \u201cgm+\u201d. The number after \u2018gm+\u2019 indicates how many difficulty thresholds it is above a typical grandmaster level; for example, a gm+2 map is two difficulty categories above grandmaster, just like how advanced is two categories above beginner. Anything above gm+2 is seldom agreed upon. The term \u201ccracked\u201d comes from the fact that, in the difficulty color meter used in various collabs, the pointer is pushed so far to the right that it goes past red and causes the meter\u2019s glass cover to crack. \u201cLobby\u201d - A map made for selecting other maps, frequently used in collabs. These are often sorted by difficulty (e.g. expert lobby, beginner lobby, etc.) \u201cGym\u201d - Maps made solely for teaching techniques to players. These maps are common to include in collabs and are often sorted by difficulty, similarly to lobbies. \u201cHeart Side\u201d - a type of map frequently placed at the end of a lobby in a collab , popularized by Spring Collab. They are typically a collection of all the other maps in a lobby. These maps are typically longer and more difficult than others in its difficulty category. These are frequently given prefixes to indicate what difficulty they are: \u201cBHS\u201d for beginner, \u201cIHS\u201d for intermediate, \u201cAHS\u201d for advanced, \u201cEHS\u201d or occasionally \u201cEXHS\u201d for expert, and \u201cGMHS\u201d for grandmaster. Oftentimes the \"heart\" portion is replaced by another word, such as the Winter Collab 2021 Fusionside serving as that collab's heart side. \u201cDashless\u201d - Just as it sounds, these are maps or challenges that disallow Madeline from dashing. \u201cDark Map\u201d - Describes a decoration style that turns tiles and entities into dark silhouettes to contrast the background. (e.g., Crimson Night, Heaven\u2019s Outer Space) (aka \"Silhouette Map\") . This may also refer to maps which obscure the map until lit up, such as the depths subchapter of chapter 5A from vanilla Celeste. \u201cEtselec\u201d - Literally the word \u201cCeleste\u201d backwards, these maps are backwards versions of other maps, where rooms are completed in reverse order from end to beginning with minimal changes made to keep them possible. (See also,"}, {"chunk_id": 41, "text": "D1D7.) \u201cGarbage Version\u201d - Modified versions of existing maps, but spammed with the moving saw blade entity from chapter 5. These maps are typically abbreviated with \u201c GV\u201d at the end of their abbreviation. CMGV, for example, is a garbage version of the map Cycle Madness. Occasionally, Garbage Versions are made with the base of another Garbage Version, resulting in often TAS-only maps like CMGVGV and CMGVGVGV. \u201c Techspam\u201d - A style of gameplay that revolves around using lots of tech in quick succession, typically with high input density. Maps using this style are usually expert or higher in difficulty due to the nature of it. An example of this style is the map \u201cS.B.W.W.\u201d. \u201cSave and Quit\u201d (aka \u201cs+q\u201d, \u201cs&q\u201d, \u201cs and q\u201d, \u201csq\u201d)- Saving and quitting is an option in the Celeste pause menu. Selecting it brings the player to the main menu, wherein whenever they choose to continue, they will continue where they left off in a chapter. Saving and quitting counts as a death and removes the player\u2019s golden strawberry if they have one. \u201cDreadcorner\u201d - The name of a strategy in the chapter 5 B-side used to skip a portion of the chapter, performed by doing a spiked cornerjump on the right side of the room where Madeline would normally require using a red booster. It is called this, as it is the faster alternative to the \u2018bubsdrop\u2019 that can be performed in this room, but is much more difficult."}]}

Table of Contents Vanilla Celeste - Vanilla Entities - Custom Entities - Vanilla Techniques and Game Mechanics - Custom Techniques and Game Mechanics - Custom Maps - Speedrunning Terminology - Community Resources - Community References - Disorganized and Miscellaneous Entries - Notes - Vanilla Celeste \u2018Vanilla\u2019 items are any items which can be found within the base game of Celeste, without mods. Below is a list of chapters, collectables, and other phenomena found within vanilla Celeste. \"Sides / Chapters\" - Each chapter in Celeste refers to a playable location such as Old Site (Chapter 2) or Mirror Temple (Chapter 5). Each chapter has an A-Side, B-Side, and C-Side, except for Chapter 9, Farewell. These can be abbreviated with the suffix of -A, -B, and -C respectively. For example, Forsaken City A-Side is 1A, and Golden Ridge B-Side is 4B. For more information, see the List of Celeste Chapters . \u201cA-side\u201d - The A-side of the chapter is the primary part of the chapter. Between A-sides, B-sides, and C-sides, A-sides are the easiest but longest, and are the only \u2018side\u2019 with any bearing on the plot. Along with strawberries, each A-side has a collectable hidden cassette tape as well as a blue crystal heart which often requires puzzle-solving. \u201cB-side\u201d - B-sides are an unlockable challenge version of a chapter, significantly more difficult than the A-side. B-sides are non-canon and have no collectable strawberries besides the ubiquitous golden strawberry. Each B-side ends with a collectable red crystal heart. \u201cC-side\u201d - C-sides are the final unlockable \u2018side\u2019 of a chapter, and are harder than B-sides. Each C-side is generally three rooms long, with the final room being the most"}, {"chunk_id": 1, "text": "difficult, making C-sides the shortest chapters in Celeste. Like B-sides, they are non-canon and have no collectable strawberries. Each C-side ends with a collectable yellow crystal heart. Prologue and Epilogue are chapters without alternate sides or collectables, they aren't shown in the Journal, and they have no abbreviation, as they are very short and lack any significant challenge. \u201cCassette\u201d - Every chapter A-side contains a collectable cassette found in a hidden room. These hidden rooms play a chip-tune music track in the background and have \u2018cassette blocks\u2019 which activate and deactivate in rhythm with the music. Collecting a cassette unlocks the B-side of the chapter. \u201cCrystal Heart\u201d - Floating heart shaped crystals with one found in each chapter. A-sides have blue crystal hearts, found somewhere hidden in the level. B-sides have red crystal hearts which serve as the end goal of the chapter. Likewise, C-sides have yellow crystal hearts which serve as the end goal of the chapter. A-Side and B-Side hearts are also individually named. \"Farewell\" - Chapter 9 of Celeste added in a free DLC on September 9th, 2019. It is far longer and more difficult than all other chapters of Celeste, and requires at least 15 Crystal Hearts to access any content past the Remembered checkpoint. This requirement can be bypassed with some tech usage. The golden strawberry for this chapter, abbreviated as \"FWG\", is widely regarded as the ultimate challenge in Celeste. The final checkpoint of Farewell is called \u2018Farewell\u2019, and to avoid confusion, this checkpoint is referred to as \"Farewell/Farewell\" or \"FWFW\". \u201cStrawberry\u201d - Strawberries are Celeste\u2019s main collectible. There are 175 main strawberries that count towards 100% completing the game, plus 27 extra strawberries that do not count towards this, for a final total of 202. Collecting six of any of these in a short period will display consecutive 1000-point rewards, starting from 1000 and increasing up to 5000, and finally displaying the text \u20181-UP\u2019 along with giving the 1UP! achievement. These points and the 1-UP are purely cosmetic, and are a reference to retro-era video games such as Super Mario World. The various types of strawberries in Celeste include: \u201cRed Strawberry\u201d - The default strawberry type. Although the exact specific mechanics of these strawberries depends on the particular strawberry, most cannot be collected unless the player is standing on solid ground in a safe area. These strawberries count towards 100% completion. \u201cWinged Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cwinged berry\u201d) - The second most common strawberry type. These strawberries function the same as red strawberries, with the added caveat that the strawberry will attempt to fly away if the player dashes in the room in which it is contained. These strawberries count towards 100% completion. \u201cSeeded Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cstrawberry seeds\u201d, \u201cseed berry\u201d)- To collect these strawberries, the player must collect a series of strawberry seeds within a room without touching the ground, which will result in the seeds returning to their position. If successful, a cutscene will play"}, {"chunk_id": 2, "text": "and the seeds will manifest as a collectable red strawberry. These strawberries count towards 100% completion. \u201cGolden Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cgolden\u201d) - Each of Celeste\u2019s chapters, as well as their B-sides and C-sides, has one golden strawberry, requiring the player to complete the chapter without dying to obtain, with the exception of Prologue and Epilogue. A distinct death sound will play if the player dies while carrying a golden strawberry. Each strawberry is referred to by taking the chapter\u2019s acronym and adding the suffix \u2018G\u2019; so the golden strawberry of the Chapter 1 A-side is 1AG, Chapter 4 C-side is 4CG, and of Farewell is \u201cFWG\u201d. This applies for custom maps as well. Golden strawberries become available after the player completes the chapter 8 B-side. These strawberries do not count towards 100% completion. \u201cWinged Golden Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cwg \u201d or \u201c1A dashless\u201d) - The only winged golden strawberry in the game appears at the end of the chapter 1 A-side. It can only be found if the player completes the full chapter without dashing, although the strawberry will reappear if the player dies in the same room they dashed in before completing the room. This is one of Celeste\u2019s most difficult collectibles, requiring niche techniques that are required nowhere else in the game, including corner jumps, a 6jump, and a 4-tile overhang. This strawberry does not count towards 100% completion. \u201cMoonberry\u201d (aka \u201cmb\u201d or, less commonly, \u201cmerry\u201d) - The only moonberry in the game sits in a hidden room within Farewell/Farewell, which can be entered if the player backtracks after clearing the electric fields. It appears as a green strawberry with a yellow \u2018Saturn ring\u2019 around it. Upon collecting it, the usual 1000 point indicator will be replaced with the flashing text \u201cWOW\u201d. Due to one of the rooms leading to it requiring the player to reset their respawn point and die to clear the room, it is the only collectable in the game which is completely impossible to collect without dying. Due to this, dying here while holding the golden strawberry is the only point in the game where the player will not be sent back to the beginning of the chapter when they die. This strawberry does not count towards 100% completion. \u201cVariants\u201d - A special menu unlocked after completing the C-side of Chapter 8, Core. It allows the player to change various settings about gameplay, such as the speed of time in-game a h d the amount of dashes one has. The settings are separated into two groups: variants and assists. A full list of the settings in the variants menu is found below: Variants \u201cGame Speed\u201d - Controls the speed of time in-game, which affects all movement, sounds and visuals in a level, This does not affect the chapter and file timers. The default value for this variant is 100%. The minimum is 50% and the maximum is 160% \u201cMirror Mode\u201d - As its name implies, mirrors the screen in-game. Also changes the position of character portraits in dialogue boxes. \u201c360"}, {"chunk_id": 3, "text": "Dashing\u201d - Missing Descriptor \u201cInvisible Motion\u201d - Madeline becomes invisible while moving, regardless if the player is holding the movement button s or not. \u201cNo Grabbing\u201d - Madeline cannot grab onto walls, which makes climbjumping impossible. Certain blocks, such as the move blocks in Chapter 4, can still be activated by holding the grab button. \u201cLow Friction\u201d - Greatly reduces Madeline\u2019s friction with the environment, making reducing her speed much more difficult. \u201cSuper Dashing\u201d - Doubles the duration of Madeline\u2019s dash and gives her the ability to control the direction of her dash during one. (Not to be confused with the technique of the same name.) \u201cHiccups\u201d - Madeline will start to hiccup every 1-2 seconds, causing her to be slightly launched upwards, even in mid-air. \u201cOther Self\u201d - Turns Madeline into Badeline . Purely cosmetic variant. Assists \u201cInfinite Stamina\u201d - Gives madeline infinite energy to climb walls. \u201cAir Dashes\u201d - Changes the amount of dashes Madeline has at any time. The settings for this are Default , 2 and Infinite . \u201cDash Assist\u201d - When dashing, stops time while holding the dash button, allowing the player to precisely control the timing and direction of their dashes. \u201cInvincibility\u201d - Makes Madeline invincible against all hazards. She will bounce on top of voids without dying to them; blocks that try to crush her will become non-solid; And, if she dashes into a wall through a Dream Block, she will bounce into the opposite direction. Vanilla Entities Vanilla entities are any entities which can be found in vanilla Celeste. Below is a list of vanilla entities. \u201c Badeline Chaser\u201d - Clones of Badeline that chase Madeline in Chapter 2, Old Site. They will be 2 seconds behind Madeline and will copy her moves exactly, killing her if touched. \u201cBooster\u201d - (aka \u201cbubble\u201d) Large bubbles that, shortly after being entered, launch the player in any direction they choose. There are two types of boosters: Green: Introduced in Chapter 4, they quickly launch the player in a chosen direction before popping, covering a distance similar to that of a dash. Red: Introduced in Chapter 5, they move in a chosen direction in a straight line indefinitely until they are popped by colliding with a solid or the player dashing out of them. \u201cCassette Bubble\u201d - After collecting a cassette, a large bubble envelops Madeline and brings her back to the start of the room. These bubbles are also used in Chapter 9, Farewell when collecting the keys in the Power Source checkpoint, where it would be impossible to return without them. Additionally, cassette bubbles are often used for strawberries in custom maps. (not to be confused with \u201cBooster\u201d, which is nicknamed \u201cbubble\u201d) \u201cCore Block\u201d - A block found in chapter 8, also known as Core. This block has two different abilities. It will launch the player if grabbed or landed on if it is in its lava state. However in its ice state it will crumble away. \u201cCore Switch\u201d - A switch found in"}, {"chunk_id": 4, "text": "Chapter 8, that causes the level to turn from lava to ice state or vice versa. This has various effects, such as making m adeline slide on the ground in ice mode, as well as entities such as core blocks and bumpers switching to a different variant. \u201cCrumble Block\u201d - Grey blocks found throughout the game, first in Chapter 1 that quickly \u201ccrumble\u201d after landing or climbing on them, causing them to become intangible. They quickly reform a short period after being broken, providing that no tiles are covering them. \u201cDream Block\u201d - The starry black blocks from Chapter 2. If these are dashed into, Madeline will continuously move through the block in the direction she dashed until she exits the block or hits a wall, the latter of which kills her. Exiting a dream block returns Madeline\u2019s dash. \u201cDust Bunny\u201d - The black and dark red creatures from Chapter 3, acting either as a static or moving obstacle. \u201cFeather\u201d - A golden feather introduced in Chapter 6, Reflection. When collected, it allows Madeline to fly in any direction for 2 seconds. While not holding in any direction, she will move much more slowly. A feather will regenerate Madeline\u2019s dash, unless she dashes out of it early. \u201cFlag\u201d - Respawn points denoted by the image of a flag, followed by a number. In the base game, they are used in Chapter 7, Summit, Sides A and B. They are also frequently used in mo d s. Flags typically count down ; so the lower the number, the closer the player is to the end. Certain flags may be abbreviated as f#, for instance, Flag 2 as F2. (Not to be confused with the #F format, which indicates the number of frames in which an action can be completed. See \u2018Frame Perfect.\u2019) \u201cHeart Gate\u201d - Large, blue walls of light with hearts on them, found on all sides of Chapter 8, Core, and halfway through Chapter 9, Farewell. They serve The hearts indicate how many crystal hearts the player must collect to open the heart gate. \u201cJellyfish\u201d - A large, parasol-shaped jellyfish introduced in Chapter 9, Farewell. When held, it will act like a parachute, greatly slowing Madeline\u2019s fall. Jellyfishes disappear when touching a seeker barrier (see below). \u201cKevin\u201d - The moving blocks with angry faces introduced in Chapter 6, Reflection, are referred to as \u2018Kevins\u2019. They get this name from the fact that they got their voices from Kevin, a developer. \u201cKey\u201d - Golden keys introduced in Chapter 3, Celestial Resort.. They are used to open locked doors and, therefore, are required to progress in a chapter. Once collected, the keys will follow Madeline around and will stay with her even if she dies. \u201cOshiro\u201d - The owner of the Celestial Resort Hotel in Chapter 3 (Celestial Resort), who turns into the main boss of the level in Presidential Suite. He periodically dashes from the right side of the screen to attack Madeline. The player may jump on Oshiro\u2019s head when he is dashing, with mechanics similar to that of the snowball or seeker entities. Being near"}, {"chunk_id": 5, "text": "Oshiro when he is dashing causes the game to slow down and the visuals to briefly turn black and white. \"Refill\" - Crystals that refill the player's dashes and stamina fully. The amount of dashes restored depends on the color and number of diamonds present. Green, singular crystals restore one dash, while pink, double crystals restore two. These can only be collected when the player lacks a dash or is flashing red due to having low stamina. Most of these will respawn after about two seconds when collected, but some will not respawn until dying or screen transitioning. \u201cSeeker\u201d - The monsters from the ends of Chapter 5, Mirror Temple A-Side and B-Side are referred to as \u2018seekers\u2019. These can be bounced off of, activate touch switches, break certain blocks, and are blocked by shimmering white Seeker Barriers that the player can pass through. \u201cSeeker Barrier\u201d - Transparent walls of light introduced in Chapter 5 which stop seekers from passing through them. They also cause any jellyfishes that touch them to disappear . \u201cSpinners\u201d - Balls of crystal spikes, often used as the main hazard in maps. The term \u2018spinner\u2019 originates from their name in the code, as they are called \u2018Static Crystal Spinners\u2019. \u201cSpinner Juice\u201d - A nickname for a background substance that automatically fills the gaps between spinners when they are close enough. The substance is purely visual and does not kill you. \u201cSwap Block\u201d - Blocks with a red circle in the middle found in Chapter 5, Mirror Temple. These will quickly move to another position when the player dashes, and will slowly return afterwards. They can be used to quickly gain momentum. \u201cTheo Crystal\u201d - A large crystal containing Theo introduced in Chapter 5. When carrying him, Madeline will be weighed down, slowing her down and preventing her from dashing and climbing. If a Theo crystal falls into a death pit, he dies and causes Madeline to die with him. Certain doors exist which only open while Madeline is carrying a Theo crystal. \u201cTouch Switch\u201d - Often called \u201ccoins\u201d are t riggers that when interacted with can open switch gates, which are blocks that move when all touch switches are triggered. \"Zip Mover\" - Blocks on conveyor belts found in Chapter 1, Forsaken City. These quickly move to the end of the conveyor when the player touches them, and can be used for fast momentum gain. (aka \"traffic block\") Vanilla Techniques and Game Mechanics [a] [b] [c] Techniques, or \u201ctech\u201d for short, are certain actions the player can perform to achieve something. Game mechanics are any mechanic that informs the way Madeline and the environment interact; since the two are inextricably linked, they are listed together. Below is a list of techniques and mechanics that exist within the vanilla game. [d] \u201c5jump\u201d - Grabbing the side of a block above spikes just above where she can hang onto the block will cause Madeline to be repositioned lower down. Doing another climbjump before this happens will allow Madeline to jump from slightly higher than she normally can, crossing a larger gap. Normally she can only cross a four tile long row of spikes, but with this technique,"}, {"chunk_id": 6, "text": "she can cross five, hence \u201c5jump.\u201d \" 6jump \" - A dashless cornerboost , done by approaching the top corner of a tile with walking speed, then climbjumping off of it for additional speed. With this, the player can cross a 6-tile gap of spikes. \u201c 7jump \u201d - A dashless double cornerboost , done the same way as a 6jump, but pressing a second jump button shortly after the first and beginning slightly lower on the wall to account for this. \"8jump\" - A very difficult tech involv ing the same tech as a 7jump, but starting with +40 speed from a ground jump, and with a third non-cornerboosting climbjump added on. This cornerboost will give +0 speed, but is required for gaining slightly more height. If starting an 8jump with more speed, the third climbjump may not be required. This mechanic is extremely precise, being subpixel dependent. (see also, \u2018subpixels\u2019.) \u201c9jump\u201d - wallboost into dcb 4 frame perfect lmao wtf\u2026 this actually fucking exists [f] \u201c10jump\u201d - \u201c11jump\u201d - \u201cArc Ultra\u201d - \u201cArchie\u201d - Entering a booster in a crouched state causes the position of the booster to shift upwards slightly, as if Madeline is uncrouching within the bubble. This has applications in speedrunning and hard clears. It\u2019s named after a little green parrot named Archie! [g] \u201cBackboost\u201d (aka \u201cbboost\u201d) - When throwing a holdable, you gain a small speed boost in the opposite direction of the throw (8 0 speed ). In this technique, you must quickly turn around to throw the holdable behind you then turn back around. Spend as little time as possible moving in the direction of the throw to minimize speed loss and make use of the backboost. \u201cBino Clip\u201d - Binoculars can be used to scroll the camera to the side and unload spinners. Ending the interaction does not cause the camera to return immediately, so this slight delay can be used to pass through unloaded spinners before they load. \u201cBino Control Storage\u201d - In rare circumstances, for example skipping a cutscene while interacting with a bino, it is possible to cancel the dummy state that binoculars give you without canceling the interaction entirely. This results in being able to have control of Madeline while also controlling the camera using the binoculars. This is usually used in combination with spinner unloading, because spinners won\u2019t be loaded if they are outside of the camera. \u201cBino Interaction Storage\u201d (aka \u201cbino storage\u201d)- Interacting with binoculars for exactly one frame and jumping on the next frame tricks the game into thinking that Madeline is interacting with the binoculars when she is not. One of the consequences of this is that a dash through a screen transition gets canceled, which means that performing a grounded ultra through a screen transition allows the 1.2x speed boost to be retained past the end of the dash. \u201cBlock Boost'' - (aka \u201cblockboost\u201d) - There is a brief nine -frame window where after letting go of a moving"}, {"chunk_id": 7, "text": "block, such as a zip mover, where Madeline can perform a wall jump off of the block and gain momentum . (Not to be confused with \u2018liftboost\u2019, a game mechanic that enables block boosts to be performed.) \u201cBoost Holdable Storage\u201d - Releasing grab while holding a throwable when getting a boost from a fish or bumper causes a strange state to occur where Madeline acts for a short time as if she isn\u2019t holding a throwable, while visually she is. Madeline can dash in this state while seemingly holding the throwable (see \u201cThrowable Dash\u201d). If grabbed, Madeline does a pickup animation, and then the Madeline will be in the regular throwable grab state. If not grabbed, or Madeline does not dash, the throwable is thrown/dropped automatically after a short time after the boost. This tech was popularized by the strawberry room, \u201cExtra Ball\u201d in Pinball Purgatory, an infamous map from the strawberry jam collab. (aka \u201cExtra ball tech\u201d, \u201ceb tech\u201d, \u201cFreeze Frame Ungrab\u201d, \u201cbumper ungrab\u201d) \u201cBubble Super/Hyper\u201d - Dashing into a bubble (called a \u2018booster\u2019 in game files) from a grounded state allows you to input a super or hyper immediately as you enter the bubble and jump from the bubble as though it were solid ground. \u201cBubsdrop\u201d - A bubsdrop is a technique used to immediately enter a downwards screen transition after entering a room from below, by doing a short jump as you enter the room to gain less height than the screen transition would give. This is notable in the chapter 5 B-side, as it allows the player to skip a portion of the chapter by resetting the player\u2019s respawn point. This video showcases an example of this phenomenon. (see also, \u2018 dreadcorner \u2019) \u201cBuffer\u201d - A game mechanic present in many modern video games where if you input the controls to perform an action before your character is able, the game will read the input and perform the action as soon as it is able. In Celeste, for example, pressing the jump button shortly before coming in contact with the ground will still result in a jump. Most inputs can be buffered up to 5 frames, notable exceptions are buffering a pause out of a pause (6 frames) and grab/ slow fall which can be buffered infinitely. \u201cBumper Boost\u201d - Holding the direction away from a bumper while colliding with it will cause Madeline to be propelled away at a much higher speed and distance. Holding the direction towards the bumper will have the opposite effect. \u201cBumper Clip\u201d - After hitting a bumper, the player can dash towards the bumper and move through it, due to a lack of collision while the bumper is inactive. Performing this technique requires the player to initially contact the bumper at a precise angle. This tech is famously explored in the map \u2018Pinball Purgatory\u2019 from the Strawberry Jam Collab. (aka \u201cphase\u201d , \u201cbumper phase\u201d , \u201cblip\u201d ) \u201cBunny Hop\u201d - Performing short jumps in quick succession allows you to move faster than walking speed. Performing"}, {"chunk_id": 8, "text": "bunnyhops also allows the player to reduce loss of momentum. (aka \u201cbunnyhop\u201d or \u201cbhop\u201d) \u201cCassette Boost\u201d - Jumping off of a cassette block within the first frame of it being active causes the jump to gain extra height. \u201cCassette Raise\u201d - Remaining inside a cassette block while it activates and deactivates causes it to move upwards by two pixels. This can be repeated indefinitely to move a cassette block upwards vertically, provided you have the means to remain inside the cassette block for the required time period. \u201cCassette Boosted Feather Super\u201d - This refers to a niche technique involving performing a jump using the momentum of exiting a feather while on an activating cassette block. Due to its specificity, it has very little application in gameplay. This tech is most often referred to humorously due to its convoluted abbreviation. This video showcases an example of this phenomenon. (aka \u201ccassoosted fuper\u201d) \u201cCeiling Pop\u201d - (aka \u201ccpop\u201d) When Madeline is at the bottom pixel of a wall, she can go under the wall and seemingly climbjump under the wall, hitting her head on the ceiling (hence why it\u2019s called a \u2018ceiling pop\u2019). This technique is extremely precise, requiring frame-perfect timing and extremely precise positio ning down to less than a pixel. (see also, \u2018frame perfect\u2019 and \u2018subpixels\u2019.) Cpops can also be performed off of spiked walls, requiring precision all the way down to a tenth of a pixel, referred to as \u201cspiked ceiling pops\u201d . \u201cCeiling Pop Cornerboost\u201d - (aka \u201cpopcorn\u201d) A tech combining ceiling pops and corner boosts. This is achieved by performing a ceiling pop with enough horizontal speed to get a corner boost under the block. [h] \u201cCeiling Pop Cornerboost Wallboost\u201d - (aka \u201cpopcornwob\u201d) A tech combining ceiling pops, corner boosts, and wallboosts. This is achieved by performing a ceiling pop cornerboost (see above), then switching directions to cancel horizontal speed with a wallboost. This can be used to jump under a block and grab onto the other side without dashing in highly specific situations. [i] \u201cChained Ultra\u201d - Performing several ultras in sequence will give Madeline an exponentially increasing speed boost. (aka \"Chultra\", \u201cChultras\u201d) \u201cClimb Boosting\u201d - This tech refers to gaining liftboost from a moving block that Madeline cannot grab. To do this, Madeline must do a wall jump from the block while holding grab. Holding grab allows Madeline to get the liftboost even when she cannot grab the block. [verify] \u201cClimbhop\u201d - Climbing onto the top of a platform causes Madeline to perform a small hop. \u201cClimbhop Cancel\u201d - Dashing during a climbhop on a moving object allows Madeline to retain the speed of the moving object into the dash, even if the dash is in a different direction to the block\u2019s movement . This has strange consequences, even including allowing the player to move through spikes under particular"}, {"chunk_id": 9, "text": "circumstances. [j] \u201cClimbhop Cancel Ceiling Pop Cornerboost Wallboost Delayed Ultra\u201d - (aka \u201cclobpopcornhob dultra\u201d) \ud83d\udc80 what the fuck \u201cClimbhop Entanglement\u201d - This niche technique allows the player to \u2018entangle\u2019 their momentum with a moving block without being in contact with that block. By canceling the animation Madeline does when climbing up to the top of a tile, which can be done (not exclusively) with a dash, then by resetting Madeline\u2019s forced x by jumping off of other walls in intervals of 12 frames or less [k] , or hitting springs in intervals of 18 frames or less, Madeline\u2019s momentum will remain \u2018entangled\u2019 with the block. This means that, as long as the block remains moving, its momentum will be applied to Madeline. If the block changes direction or stops moving, Madeline\u2019s momentum will also reflect this. [l] \u201cClimbjump\u201d (aka \u201cclimb jump\u201d) - While holding a wall, jumping while holding the direction towards the wall or upwards will result in a climbjump. This will consume 27.5 units of stamina, one quarter of Madeline\u2019s maximum stamina. \u201cCoffee Jump\u201d - A coffee jump is simply a corner jump performed off of a one tile overhang, starting from a wall. It is performed by pressing the jump button twice in rapid succession, more easily with two jump keys. It is called the coffee jump, as it is a required technique for the winged golden strawberry in the chapter 1 A-side, on the screen that has a caf\u00e9 in the background. \u201cCore Super\u201d / \u201cCore Hyper\u201d - Performing a Super or Hyper dash during a brief window as a core block is destroyed allows Madeline to super or hyper dash with the added momentum of the core block. \u201c Cornerboost \u201d (aka \u201c coost \u201d, \u201ccboost\u201d or \"cb\") - Climbjumping into the top corner of a tile with some momentum will give a small speed boost. The speed boost will only apply if Madeline inputs a jump prior to grabbing the wall. This is particularly useful as a means of canceling a dash and keeping the dash speed beyond the usual duration of the dash (like a Super Dash). Note that, although niche, a cornerboost can also be performed off of the bottom corner of a wall if the wall is moving vertically upwards with high enough speed, as this means that the wall will be above Madeline during the jump portion of the cornerboost meaning that she will avoid colliding with it . \u201cCornerboost Wallboost\u201d - A wallboost from a cornerboost. This entails performing a cornerboost with a neutral climbjump (without holding horizontally) and then holding away from the direction climb jumped. Notably, this can instantly remove high amounts of speed due to the properties of a wallboost. (aka \u201ccobwob\u201d, \u201cwoosted coost\u201d, \u201ccornerboosted wallboost\u201d) \u201cCornerslip\u201d - Coming within 1 pixel vertically of a platform without landing on the platform allows Madeline\u2019s dash to"}, {"chunk_id": 10, "text": "be refilled without resetting vertical speed. This is often (incorrectly) referred to as a \u2018jasig jump\u2019 as it often occurs when performing the speedrun strategy \u2018jasig\u2019. \u201cCorner Correction\u201d - A leniency mechanic in which jumping or dashing into the corner of a solid surface in a given direction causes Madeline to automatically move around the corner instead of getting stopped by it. For example, jumping or dashing upwards into a corner on a ceiling will cause Madeline to move around the corner as long as she is, at most, 4 pixels away from the corner and moving towards the ceiling, which makes techniques such as wallbouncing more lenient. \u201cCorner Jump\u201d (aka \u201ccjump\u201d) - Jumping off of the corner of a block will result in a wall jump. . (Sometimes it is referred to as \u201c cump \u201d, though this abbreviation is often avoided due to sounding suggestive.) \u201cCorner kick\u201d (aka \u201cckick\u201d)- Jumping into the corner of a block from underneath, then jumping again once the block is crossed, will allow Madeline to wall jump off of the corner. ( Corner Jumps and Corner Kicks are not to be confused. ) \u201cCoyote Time\u201d - Coyote time refers to the game allowing certain actions to be performed after they should technically no longer be possible. Jumping a few frames after walking off of a ledge will still result in a jump, for instance. Coyote time is responsible for making various other techniques possible, including dream hypers/supers and core supers/hypers. Like buffering, coyote time is a feature of various other games; in Celeste the window for coyote time is five frames. The mechanic\u2019s name is a reference to Wile E. Coyote, a character from Looney Tunes. \u201cDash\u201d - One of the basic actions the player can perform. By holding a direction and pressing Dash, the player can dash in one of eight directions. By default, Madeline can only do this once. Afterwards she must regain the dash by touching the ground, collecting a refill, interacting with an entity, or entering a screen transition. When Madeline has one dash, her hair is red; when she has no dashes, her hair is light blue, and when she has two dashes, her hair turns pink and floaty. \u201cDash Attack\u201d - A leniency mechanic wherein there is a 5 frame window [verify] after a dash ends in which dash-activated entities, such as dream blocks and kevin blocks, can still be activated. [m] \u201cDash Bounce\u201d - Dashing within 2 frames of inputting a wallbounce gives you a slight vertical bump when the dash ends. This is because the game applies a constant vertical speed to Madeline for 17 frames when doing a wall bounce, whereas Madeline\u2019s dash lasts for 15 frames. (aka \u201cdashbounce\u201d, \u201cdounce\u201d, or sometimes \u201cshaboingboing\u201d.) \u201cDash Redirection\u201d - When dashing, the game freezes for 3 frames. During this period, [n] the player can change the direction of their dash. This is what allows crouch dashes to be"}, {"chunk_id": 11, "text": "performed manually, as when dashing dowards, Madeline crouches, and when redirecting a downwards dash into another direction, she stays crouched. \u201cDash Trigger\u201d - Missing Descriptor; include information on Dash Trigger Skip (DTS) [o] \u201cDelayed Block Boost\u201d - A block boost may still be performed if the player is no longer in contact with the block, instead wall jumping off of another surface within the nine-frame window of being in contact with the block. This phenomenon is rarely called a \u201cdelayed block boost\u201d, though sometimes it is just referred to as a block boost. This video showcases an example of this phenomenon. (aka \u2018momentum carry\u2019) [p] \u201cDelayed Ultra\u201d (aka \u201cdultra\u201d) - Canceling a diagonal down dash before the dash ends and before touching the floor gives Madeline the 1.2x speed boost from the ultra the next time she contacts the floor , essentially storing the speed boost to be used later. Canceling the dash can be achieved in several ways, including climbjumping during the dash or entering a feather. \u201cDemo Dash\u201d (aka \u201cdemo\u201d) - Crouching while dashing horizontally will preserve the crouched hitbox while dashing. This action can be mapped to a single input in the controls menu. This has a wide variety of implications, including allowing the player to squeeze through gaps they normally can\u2019t. Demos cannot be performed if the player is in air and crouching and will instead cause the player to uncrouch immediately, which also means that a demo dash cannot be buffered out of another demo dash like normal dashes can. (aka \u201ccrouch dash\u201d) \u201cDemo Hyper\u201d - Dashing diagonally downward, followed by a jump, will result in a hyper dash. However, the player can perform a hyper dash by demo dashing horizontally as well. This is called a \u2018demo hyper\u2019. Demo hypers have some additional utility compared to normal hypers; they can give more distance due to the dash extending slightly further, as well as allowing players to perform the technique in midair or on dream blocks, for instance. (see also, \u2018midair super\u2019). \u201cDeleting Madeline Safely\u201d - Missing Descriptor (??????) \u201cDouble Cornerboost \u201d (aka \u201cdcb\u201d) - Performing two cornerboosts on the same tile, often by using two jump buttons in quick succession. (not to be confused with \u2018Depths Cornerboost\u2019 [speedrunning trick, needs entry] , which also uses the acronym \u2018dcb\u2019) \u201cDream Boost\u201d (aka \u201cdroost\u201d) - When Madeline exits a dream block, the minuscule boost she gets from it is called a \u201cdream boost\u201d. This mechanic is most often referred to in the context of the niche \u2018splipped droost\u2019 technique. (see \u2018splipped droost\u2019) [q] \"Dream Double Jump\" - Pressing jump just before exiting a dream block, and again in the coyote time given from exiting a dream block will cause a jump that has more distance/height than a normal dream jump"}, {"chunk_id": 12, "text": ". This is because a jump adds 40 horizontal speed, so the second jump would both add another 40 speed on top of the first, as well as having slightly more height than a normal dream jump would. (aka \"ddj\") \u201cDream Grab\u201d - While exiting a dream block from a side, hold the grab button and the opposite direction of movement to cling onto the edge of the dream block. \u201cDream Grab Hyper\u201d - a player can perform a hyper out of a dream block within five frames of exiting the dream block, even if they perform a dream grab first. This is particularly useful with Theo (see \u2018theohyper\u2019). \u201cDream Hyper/Super\u201d - Inputting a hyper/super during the five-frame coyote time window given after exiting a dream block will give the height and distance of a hyper/super dash, but will consume the player\u2019s dash. (see also, \u2018coyote time\u2019) Dream hypers cannot be performed if the player enters the dream block crouched or vertically. (aka \u201cdryper\u201d) \u201cDream Jump\u201d - Press Jump while exiting the dream block to jump out of the dream block. This works in all directions. There are a total of 13 frames for this, 5 buffer frames, 3 freeze frames and then 5 coyote frames. (See also, \u2018Coyote Time\u2019.) You cannot Dream Jump if you enter the block vertically. \u201cDream Smuggle\u201d - By dashing into a dream block and grabbing an object right before entering it, Madeline can carry held objects while dashing through Dream Blocks. Although this technique is technically vanilla, it has no practical use. It has more prevalence in custom Celeste maps. (aka \u201csmuggle\u201d, \u201cdream smuggle\u201d) \u201cExtended Super/Hyper\u201d - Performing a super or hyper and waiting 10 frames before jumping will return Madeline\u2019s dash. \"Extended\" is sometimes shortened to \"ex\" or \"ext\". \u201cFailed Neutral\u201d - A term used to refer to jumping away from a wall and immediately steering back towards it without performing a neutral, which loses a small amount of height on the wall. This is generally only used to set up a consistent subpixel positioning for other techniques, such as demos. \u201cFast Bubble\u201d - Pressing Dash while in a bubble will cause the bubble to move in a direction sooner than usual. (aka \u201cfastbubble\u201d, or \"fubble\") \u201cFast Fall\u201d - While falling, holding down will make you fall much faster . Madeline\u2019s sprite appears to narrow while fastfalling . [r] \u201cFeather Bounce\u201d - This refers to when a player bounces off of a wall to change directions quickly, usually doing a 180 degree turn. \u201cFeather Clip\u201d - Using a feather against the top of a jump-through platform will allow Madeline to clip through the platform. You must be holding down against the jump through when the feather expires. [s] \u201cFeather Super\u201d - Jumping along a solid surface while in the feather state will result in a longer, faster jump akin to a Super Dash. (see also \u2018Super Dash\u2019) (aka \u201cfuper\u201d, more"}, {"chunk_id": 13, "text": "often used in \u2018cassoosted fuper\u2019). \u201c Forced x \u201d - This game mechanic temporarily forces a player to move in a specific direction for a certain number of frames. For example, a player is locked into moving right for 12 frames after performing a rightward wall jump. \u201cFrame Perfect\u201d - These are a category of maneuvers that can only be performed on one single frame. Frames are the smallest increment of time in a video game. Celeste runs at 60 Frames per second, so each frame is one sixtieth of a second. The format for abbreviating these maneuvers is the number of frames in which a maneuver can be executed, followed by F. So for one frame maneuvers, the abbreviation is 1F. (Not to be confused with F#, which indicates a flag or checkpoint. See \u2018Flag.\u2019 Also not to be confused with \u20182f\u2019, an April Fools map by Ellis Vesper which requires its own section under custom maps.) [t] \u201cFreeze Frame\u201d - While interacting with certain mechanics or performing certain actions, such as bubbles or bumpers, t he game will briefly stop . (aka \u201cFF\u201d.) \u201cGrabless Dream Hyper\u201d (aka Mickey Mouse?) Missing Descriptor \u201c Grounded Ultra\u201c - A down diagonal dash that collides with the ground before the dash ends. These can be chained by wavedashing out of the first down diagonal dash, then quickly dashing in the same direction again. Colliding with the ground out of the down diagonal dash will still provide a 1.2x speed boost, but the speed boost will not persist after the dash ends. This is the fastest method of travel across flat ground. (aka \"Gultra\", \u201cGultras\u201d ) \u201cGrounded Wallboost\u201d - A niche technique involving performing a wallbo st shortly before being grounded . This is done by grabbing a wall at the highest point [u] , doing a short hop neutral climbjump, holding towards the wall, and then wallboosting, usually followed by a coyote jump off the ground. Often, a cornerslip is performed after the wallboost to get the coyote jump from lower down. (aka \u201cgwoost\u201d.) \u201cHalf Stamina Climb\u201d - A technique done by doing neutral climb jump, followed by a wallboost and the a climbjump up to 2 frames after the wallb ost (sometimes must be 1f after due to subpixels). This results in a jump from the wall with less speed, since the climb jump acts as a reverse cornerboost, reducing speed by 40. Only the second of the two climbjumps uses up stamina (since the wallboost refunds the first climbjump\u2019s usage), hence the name. (More detail on where an nrcb is used may or may not be useful) [v] \u201cHeart Ultra\u201d - Dashing down diagonally at the exact moment Madeline bounces off a crystal heart allows her to collect it while maintaining the momentum of the bounce through the down diagonal dash. By spending Madeline\u2019s dash before attempting to perform this technique, making use of buffering, this technique can be performed more leniently. This technique is usually only performed for flavor, but is sometimes useful. This tech can also be used to collect"}, {"chunk_id": 14, "text": "a heart, then cancel the heart collect by entering a screen transition. (aka \u201chultra\u201d) \u201cHoldable Climbjump\u201d - Repeatedly neutral dropping a holdable object, climbjumping up the wall and picking up the object allows Madeline to scale a wall while still having the object. (aka \u201ctheo climb\u201d, \u201cjelly climb\u201d) \u201cHoldable Dash\u201d - Dashing while in a holdable storage state . This allows madeline to dash after a boost while seemingly holding a holdable, by releasing grab when getting the boost. (see \u2018Boost Holdable Storage\u2019. Note that this tech may also be called extra ball tech.) \u201cHoldable Lift\u201d - Throwing a held object at a wall, then dashing up into the object while holding Grab as it rebounds off of the wall, will allow the player to gain some height with a held object. It is most easily and effectively performed with jellyfish, but can be performed with heavy objects as well. (not to be confused with \u2018jellyvator\u2019, \u2018theovator\u2019, \u2018jelly regrab\u2019, or \u2018jelly ladder\u2019.) [w] \u201cHyper Bunny Hop\u201d - Performed by following up a hyper dash with a tiny jump, followed by a full jump, this technique allows Madeline to gain significantly more height and momentum than a hyper dash. (aka \u201chyper bunnyhop\u201d, \u201chyper bhop\u201d, or less commonly, \u201chbhop\u201d.) \u201cHyper Dash\u201d - Following a down-diagonal dash on the ground with a Jump will result in a high-speed, low-height jump. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to performing a dash. (aka \u201chyper\u201d) \u201cInstant Hyper\u201d - This tech refers to performing a hyper with little delay between the dash and the jump. \u201cInstant Super\u201d - This tech refers to performing a super with little delay between the dash and the jump. \u201cJelly Bump\u201d - Holding jump when grabbing a jellyfish at speed will cause the jellyfish to boost upwards, even when dashing downright or down into the jellyfish. [x] \u201cJelly Juggle\u201d - This does not refer to a particular technique, but when the player has multiple jellyfish around them and switches between them, it is called \u2018juggling\u2019. [y] \u201cJelly Ladder\u201d - Having upwards momentum while repeatedly grabbing and neutral dropping two jellyfish allows Madeline to infinitely gain height by exploiting the upward boost from grabbing a jellyfish. Slowfalling makes this tech more lenient to perform. \u201cJelly Neutrals\u201d - Repeatedly neutral dropping a jelly, neutral jumping off the wall and picking up the jelly allows Madeline to ascend a wall while retaining a jelly and not using stamina (see \u2018Neutral jumps\u2019). Note that you can also do this by gliding back to the wall using the jelly, but that requires a lot more horizontal space than is often available. This is not to be confused with holdable climbjumping . \u201cJelly Regrab\u201d - Throwing a Jellyfish while in"}, {"chunk_id": 15, "text": "midair, then immediately diagonal dashing back into it, will allow you to gain some extra height and distance from the jellyfish. Regrabbing a jellyfish can be performed horizontally, as well, if starting from a neutral drop. If done vertically, it is instead called \u2018jellyvator\u2019. Regrabs can also be performed on heavier objects, such as Theo\u2019s crystal, but this is much more difficult and sometimes requires the player to dash more than once to catch the object. \u201cJellyvator\u201d - Neutral dropping from a jellyfish then dashing up into the jellyfish while holding Grab allows the player to gain some height while holding the jellyfish. This technique is similar to \u2018holdable lift\u2019, but does not require a nearby wall to perform the technique. When done with a heavier object, such as Theo\u2019s crystal, it is called \u201ctheovator\u201d. (not to be confused with \u2018jelly regrab\u2019 or \u2018holdable lift\u2019.) \u201cKermit Dash\u201d - Missing Descriptor \u201cKoral Skip \u201d - When Madeline is pushed against the border of a screen by certain entities, including Kevins or zip movers, Madeline will \u2018teleport\u2019 to the other side of the entity. This is called Koral Skip, I think, for some reason. Need verification . [z] \u201cLaunch Dash Redirect\u201d - Missing Descriptor \u201cLava Neutral\u201d - The player can neutral off of lava and ice with frame perfect timing. [aa] \u201cLava Wall Jump\u201d - The player can also walljump off of lava with frame perfect timing. \u201cLiftboost\u201d - This is a game mechanic that applies the speed of a moving block onto Madeline. There is a nine -frame window where Madeline can gain a boost in momentum from a moving block, even after she is no longer touching the block or if the block stops moving. (Not to be confused with \u2018block boost\u2019, a technique that utilizes the mechanic liftboost.) \u201cLow Speed Ultra\u201d - When you start a down diagonal dash toward the ground, too high to initiate a wavedash, then jump with the slight extra speed of that dash. This is normally an ultra, but if performed with no initial speed boost, this ultra will result in a minimal gain in speed, which cannot be used to chain speed boosts. (see the buffering section in \u2018 Ultras and You \u2019 ). (These may also be referred to as a \u201c Failed Wavedash\u201d . This term is rarely used, due to its misleading or confusing name, given that there are several ways to \"fail\" a wavedash. (aka \u201cfyper\u201d, \u201cfailed hyper\u201d or \u201ccarwash\u201d) [ab] \u201cMidair Hyper\u201d - Starting in midair, demo dashing while level with some ground and jumping when reaching that ground will have Madeline perform a hyper dash. To avoid confusing these with wavedashes, they are often called \u201cmidair demo hypers\u201d or simply \u201cdemo hypers\u201d. (see also \u2018demo hyper\u2019, and \u2018wavedash\u2019.) \u201cMidair Super\u201d - Starting"}, {"chunk_id": 16, "text": "in midair, dashing while level with some ground and jumping when reaching that ground will have Madeline perform a super dash. \u201cMoonboost\u201d - Performing a super dash or demo hyper into the top three pixels of a moon block will push the moon block while simultaneously correcting the player to be on top of the moon block due to corner correction, resulting in a speed boost not possible on normal terrain. (See also, \u2018moon block\u2019 and \u2018corner correction\u2019.) (aka \u201cmoost\u201d) \u201cMultiboost\u201d - A technique where multiple boosts are gained from a block in quick succession, possible because of the properties of liftboost. There are many different ways to gain multiple block boosts, but the most common and easiest is to jump from a moving block and then immediately dash down-diagonally. (aka \u201cdbb\u201d for \u2018double block boost\u2019.) \u201cNeutral Drop\u201d - Holding Down and letting go of Grab while holding an object will cause Madeline to drop whatever she is holding in place instead of flinging it in the direction she is facing. \u201cNeutral Jump\u201d - Jumping from a wall while holding no direction will not consume any stamina , and will push Madeline a very short distance from the wall. This is useful, as you can then press back towards the direction of the wall to perform another neutral jump. This allows you to scale walls without grabbing the wall or consuming stamina. (aka \u201cneutrals\u201d, \u201cneutral climb\u201d, or \u201cneutral wall jump\u201d.) \u201cNeutral Reverse Cornerboost\u201d - A reverse cornerboost, but with a neutral climbjump (you release horizontal inputs before climbjumping ) This means that you do not lose the 40 speed you usually do, so usually are more efficient for speed if followed by another dash. However, since the climbjump is neutral, there is the possibility of wallbosting afterwards, which sets your speed to a constant. To avoid this, you should dash before holding downleft, and then change to holding downleft in freeze frames (to redirect the dash) (aka \u201cnrcb\u201d) \"Overclocking\" - This refers to any tech that results in Madeline receiving more stamina than her normal maximum using a wallboost. Most commonly this is done by performing a wallboost while in contact with the ground. Because the player is starting from the ground, stamina is not consumed by the action , however, the stamina refund is still applied, giving Madeline extra stamina. This is just one example; this tech can be performed by resetting Madeline\u2019s stamina in any way in the middle of a wallboost. (see also \u201cwallboost\u201d.) (Not to be confused with \u201cgrounded wallbost\u201d) \u201cOverhangs\u201d - A dashless tech which is performed when Madeline jumps from one wall and jumps onto the same wall but bulged by a few tiles. The easiest overhangs are 1-3 tile overhangs, which are very lenient and quite easy to pull off. However, 4tiles, 5tiles, and 6tiles require much more precise and difficult moves to pull off.. There are also a couple of niche overhangs, including 3x2 which is when Madeline"}, {"chunk_id": 17, "text": "has to jump 3 tiles horizontally and 2 tiles vertically, and a 2x1 which is 2 tiles horizontally and 1 tile vertically. \u201cPerfect Cornerjump\u201d (aka \u201cpcj\u201d, sometimes referred to jokingly as \u201c penis cock jump \u201d) Missing Descriptor [ac] [ad] [ae] [af] \u201cPuffer Boost\u201d - Similar to \u2018Bumper Boost\u2019, this technique involves holding the direction away from a pufferfish as it explodes to gain more speed and distance. Holding the direction towards the pufferfish has the opposite effect. (aka \u201cFish Boost\u201d, \u201cFoost\u201d) \"Reform Tech\" - Blocks that break and respawn (Move Blocks, Core Blocks etc.) respawn initially without their spikes and the spikes load in shortly after. This gives a brief window of time to land on the top of the block. \u201cRetention Tech\u201d - Entering a booster in a particular way (specific details needed) puts Madeline in a strange state where the game thinks she\u2019s inside the bubble, while Madeline is still moving outside of the bubble. This allows the player to fire the bubble, immediately snapping Madeline back inside of the bubble. [ag] \"Reverse Cornerboost\" - P erforming an up-diagonal dash from underneath a bottom corner of a wall with high speed, and then turning around and climbjumping off of the wall cancels the dash and allows the dash momentum to be retained into the climbjump . \u201cReverse Super\u201d, \u201cReverse Hyper\u201d or \u201cReverse Wavedash\u201d - While performing a super, hyper, or wavedash, jumping in the opposite horizontal direction to the dash causes the resulting speed to be given in the opposite direction to normal. As with a regular super/hyper/wavedash, if Madeline is in contact with the floor on or after the 10th frame of the dash, she will retain her dash, which is called 'extending'. This technique is typically used to extend a super/hyper/wavedash off a small platform against a wall, where it would normally not be possible to. Reverse is sometimes shortened to \u2018rev\u2019. \u201cRoboboost\u201d - An extremely complicated TAS-only speedrun technique. Needs elaboration . [ah] [ai] [aj] [ak] [al] \u201cScreen Transition Cassette Offset\u201d - Using a screen transition as a cassette block activates causes all cassette blocks of that color in the new screen to be one pixel higher, and all cassette blocks of the previous color to be one pixel lower . This video showcases an example of this phenomenon. \u201cSeeker Boost\u201d - Similarly to a bumper boost or puffer boost, holding the direction away from a seeker at the moment it respawns will propel Madeline away from the seeker at a much higher speed and distance. Due to the difficulty in execution, this technique is seldom used. (See also, \u2018bumper boost\u2019) \u201cShoryuken\u201d - [am] \"Slow Fall\" - While holding the jump button as Madeline is in a jump arc, Madeline\u2019s descent will be slightly slowed down until she reaches maximum falling velocity. Unlike Fast Falling, this technique is very difficult"}, {"chunk_id": 18, "text": "to discern from regular falling, as the difference is so small and there is no physical change in Madeline\u2019s sprite. [Verify] [an] [ao] \u201cSnake Ultra\u201d - This refers to an ultra that can be performed with superdash by having the player dash downright, shift down, then downright, then right, or vice versa. This gives the player high speed and results in an S-shaped dash pattern (aka \u201csnultra\u201d. Some people mistakenly believe that this tech is called a \u201csnail ultra\u201d.) \u201cSpike d Climb\u201d - I f Madeline maintains low speed away from a spiked wall, she can remain within a 2 pixel distance away from it, and therefore still able to jump off the wall (due to wall jump leniency) without the dying to the spikes since she has speed moving in the direction that they face. Spike climbs in which Madeline moves a significant distance up the wall are sometimes TAS-only. An example of a spike climb can be found here , though not all spike climbs are as long as this. (aka \u201cspike climb\u201d, \u201csplimb\u201d) \u201cSpike Clip\u201d If Madeline is moving downwards at a high enough velocity [ap] towards spikes with no tile beneath them, Madeline may move through the spike without dying. The way that she does this is by having the bottom pixel of her hurtbox go from above the spike hitbox to below it in 1 frame, essentially frame skipping the spike. The reason this happens is because the developers made it so that the bottom pixel is the only pixel that needs to be touching the spike in order for madeline to get killed. (aka \u201cspikeclip\u201d, this tech is sometimes also called \u201cspikefall\u201d or \u201cspike fall\u201d, but this term can also refer to a setup to perform a spike clip.) \u201cSpike Clipped Dream Boost\u201d - When there are spikes surrounding a dream block and Madeline does a perfect dash towards a corner, it\u2019s possible for Madeline to seemingly clip through the spikes and get the boost from the dream block despite there being no area for Madeline to touch the dream block. Due to its precision and limited application, it is rarely used in custom maps. This tech is most often referred to as a joke. (aka \u201cSplipped Droost\u201d.) \u201cSpike Jump\u201d - When an external object, such as wind or zip movers, pushes Madeline into spikes or pushes spikes into Madeline while Madeline has speed away from the spikes, there is a brief window of time where she can jump off the wall behind the spikes due to the order in which Celeste handles operations. (Not to be confused with Corner Jumps, Corner Kicks or 5 /6 Jumps) \u201cSpiked Cornerboost\u201d - A spiked cornerboost is a precise cornerboost on a spike-covered tile performed by positioning Madeline just above the spike hitbox, but low enough to perform a wall jump from the tile. \u201cSpiked Wallbounce\u201d - Madeline can perform a wallbounce off of a spiked tile if the jump is performed during the three frames of leniency after the 15 normal frames of dash (see also, \u2018dash attack\u2019) and"}, {"chunk_id": 19, "text": "if the player holds in the same direction that the spikes are facing. [aq] [ar] \u201cSpinner Stun\u201d - This is a difficult technique that exploits the system. By unpausing and pausing on consecutive frames, the player can prevent the spinners\u2019 hitboxes from loading, allowing Madeline to pass through them. By beginning the process of loading in a group of spinners (each screen has three spinner groups) while Madeline is near enough to them to load, and pausing constantly, allowing the game to only run unpaused for one or two frames at a time, the spinners will remain unloaded. (aka \u201cstun\u201d) \u201cSpinner Unload\u201d - Spinner Unloads refer to a variety of tech that involve unloading the spinners on a screen in some way. There are many ways to do this. The most common way is to move so that the spinners are no longer on screen. If the player can somehow move offscreen, the spinners will be unloaded and Madeline can safely move through them. This can be achieved by having high enough speed that the spinners don\u2019t have enough time to load when they come onscreen or that Madeline herself is offscreen. This can also be achieved with a glitch that involves waiting 119 hours (need exact amount of time) for two thirds of the spinners in a room to unload. [as] \"Spring Cancel\" - Dashing quickly after hitting a spring cancels the momentum from the spring. (aka \"sprancel\") \u201cSquish Refill\u201d - Missing Descriptor \u201cStamina\u201d - Stamina is a stat istic which depletes when Madeline either climbs up a wall, hangs onto a wall or performs a climbjump. Madeline\u2019s maximum stamina is 110 units. When she runs out of stamina, she will no longer be able to grab walls. Madeline\u2019s sprite will begin to flash red when she has below 20 units of stamina, at which point she will be able to continue holding a wall until she runs out of stamina but cannot grab another wall. She may still climbjump. Madeline will instantly regain stamina by touching the ground, interacting with an entity, collecting a refill, or entering a screen transition. Note that climbing down a wall does not deplete stamina. \u201cStamina Canceling\u201d - When climbing a wall, holding up and tapping grab repeatedly instead of simply holding up and grab. When done correctly, this uses less stamina than climbing the wall normally. \u201cSubpixels\u201d - Madeline's position, as well as some other entities such as the Theo Crystal and Seekers, are saved as a Float (decimal) value. [au] This means that despite their positions only being shown as occupying a certain set of pixels, their position is actually significantly more precise than that. This subpixel position can be manipulated by performing certain actions, such as dashing into a wall, landing on the ground, or climbjumping into a ceiling. Occasionally, when needing to fall into a pixel perfect gap for example, Madeline's subpixel position may sometimes prevent her from getting to the needed pixel by just holding in that direction, which is due to movement speed being a decimal number of pixels per frame. \u201cSuperdash\u201d - A mechanic that appears in the"}, {"chunk_id": 20, "text": "\u2018variants\u2019 menu wherein Madeline is given a longer dash which can be course-corrected. Some custom maps can have this mechanic set by default for a unique challenge. (Not to be confused with \u2018Super Dash\u2019.) \u201cSuper Dash\u201d (usually just \u201csuper\u201d) - Following a horizontal Dash on the ground with a Jump will allow Madeline to perform a longer and faster jump with the same height as a normal jump. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to performing a dash. (Not to be confused with \u2018Superdash\u2019.) \u201cSuperwave\u201d - An extended super dash quickly followed by a reverse wavedash. Usually performed on crumble platforms and pink clouds. \u201cTheo Stall\u201d - \u201cThrowable Dream Hyper\u201d - A dream hyper done while holding a throwable. To perform this tech, you must perform a dream grab and then a dream hyper in quick succession after leaving a dream block. If you do not dream grab, the throwable is dropped/thrown upon leaving the dream block. (aka \u201ctheo dryper\u201d, \u201ctheo dream hyper\u201d) \u201cUltra\u201d - Colliding with the ground from a down diagonal dash will give Madeline a 1.2x speed boost, and, if this collision happens after the dash ends, allow preservation of that speed. A jump is often used after this to preserve speed and gain more distance. For further detail, see the Ultras and You doc. This is sometimes called an \"Ultra Dash\", but that term is inaccurate, as there are several parts to an ultra apart from the dash. (aka \u201cUltras\u201d.) (That said, because of how ultras are introduced and nuance with getting the 1.2x speed multiplier may lead to people having inconsistent definitions of ultras and related terms.) \u201cUndemo\u201d - a niche tech allowing the first frame of a down or down diagonal dash to be done without crouch. It is performed by starting a regular dash that is not down or down diagonal and then redirecting to down or down diagonal (the inverse of a manual demo). \u201c Wallboost\u201d - Doing a neutral climbjump then holding away from the wall within 11 frames will refund the stamina consumed by the move and instantly sets speed to 130 in the direction opposite of the wall. (aka \u201cwoost\u201d) (not to be confused with \u201cwallbounce.\u201d) \u201cWallbounce\u201d - Dashing up and pressing Jump near a wall allows you to jump very high off of the wall. This technique is introduced in chapter 7B in vanilla Celeste. (aka \"wounce\" or \u201cwbounce\u201d, not to be confused with \u201cwallboost\u201d.) \u201cWall Jump\u201d - If Madeline is right next to a wall, she can do a wall jump away from the wall, or in the neutral direction. Doing this in the neutral direction is called a \u2018neutral jump\u2019. If Madeline jumps in the direction towards the wall while holding the wall, she will consume some stamina and jump in the direction towards the wall , which is called a \u2018 climbjump \u2019. If she is not holding the wall but attempts any wall jump other than a neutral jump, she will jump away"}, {"chunk_id": 21, "text": "from the wall instead. This is often the result of running out of stamina. (see also, \u2018neutral jump\u2019 and \u2018climb jump\u2019.) \u201cWater Boost\u201d - When near the top of a pool of water, Madeline can jump and if moving in a direction her jump grants the normal +40 speed boost. This can be performed every frame until Madeline is out of the water allowing the ability to get 200+ speed then any prior speed entering the water. Although this technique is not TAS-only, TAS bots can perform this technique more proficiently than human players. \u201cWavedash\u201d - Starting in midair, dashing towards the ground and jumping just before hitting the ground will give Madeline her dash back and propel her forward, similarly to an extended hyper. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to a dash. This technique is introduced and used extensively in Farewell. \u201cWrap Hyper\u201d - This refers to when the player performs a dream hyper out of a dream block that they entered while crouched by performing a dream grab to uncrouch then inputting a hyper during coyote frames. It is very similar to performing a standard dream grab hyper, without theo, and done to uncrouch. It does not work diagonally. It is called this because Bred was eating a wrap when she decided to name it. Yup. \u201cYump\u201d - Missing Descriptor Custom Maps [av] Custom maps are maps created by the Celeste community to be played and enjoyed. Below is a list of some of the most historically important and highly regarded custom Celeste maps that exist, but it must be noted that this list is incomplete due to the sheer increasing number of existing custom Celeste maps. We can add a resource to find more Celeste maps here too; I\u2019m thinking gamebanana or one of the more reputable map lists that exists. \u201cStrawberry Jam Collab\u201d - a large mod released in 2023, currently the largest Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSJ2023\u201d, \u201cSJ2021\u201d, \u201cStrawberry Jam\u201d, or \"SJ\".) Below is a list of maps from Strawberry Jam, arranged in roughly ascending difficulty: SJ Beginner Lobby \u201cForest Path\u201d - a green beginner map which takes place in a dark forest. The map utilizes dream refills, which allow you to dash through normal blocks as if they were a dream block. This is the easiest map in strawberry jam, and is a likely first map in strawberry jam. \u201cAzure Caverns\u201d - a green beginner map taking place in a lush cave filled with boiling hot water. This map utilizes traffic blocks that only activate upon dashing into it, similar to a Kevin block. \u201cLoopy Lagoon\u201d - a green beginner map which takes place in an ocean of milk. The map is built around the mechanic of the giant cereal flakes, which resemble square Froot Loops. These cereal flakes have unique properties which bounce Madeline depending on how she interacts with them. \u201cCollapsing Skyline\u201d - a green beginner map which takes place in a collapsing and ruined city filled with skyscrapers. This map utilizes dash blocks from mirror temple and falling blocks to create a simple but uneasy"}, {"chunk_id": 22, "text": "platforming challenge. \u201cSeeing is Believing\u201d - a green beginner map which is famous for its unique gameplay. This map features extremely easy gameplay, however you must do it without seeing. The intended way to play is to play blindfolded as a friend guides you through the map. However, most people do not have friends, so this map includes an alternative route where the room is completely darkened, with Badeline guiding the player through instead. \u201cIf my \u2018driveway\u2019 almost did you in\u2026\u201d - a yellow beginner map which takes place in the same area as the prologue in vanilla celeste. The map is a reference to the prologue, where Madeline walks under a falling block. When she tells granny this, she laughs at Madeline and says, \u201cif my \u2018driveway\u2019 almost did you in, the Mountain might be a bit much for you,\u201d hence the name of the map. This entity, used only for this interaction in the vanilla game, is explored more thoroughly by this map. (aka \u201cdriveway\u201d) \u201cCassette Cliffs\u201d - a yellow beginner map that takes place at the top of a giant rainforest. This map uses cassette blocks, cassette traffic blocks, and other types of cassette blocks there are, hence why it\u2019s called \u201ccassette cliffs\u201d. (aka \u201cccliffs\u201d) \u201cOver the City\u201d - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a city at night. This somewhat lengthy and winding map disables Madeline\u2019s dash so it may focus solely on the jump crystal mechanic. (aka \u201cotc\u201d) \u201cTroposphere\u201d - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a dream set above the mountain. This map is a somewhat simple platforming puzzle focusing on Badeline boosts and dream blocks. \u201cPotential for Anything\u201d A yellow beginner map which utilizes gravity inversion mechanics. This map is a reference to the video game VVVVVV. \u201cMidnight Spire\u201d - A yellow beginner map that takes place in a blue tower. The background implies that the map also takes place in a mountainous region with a giant lake in the center. This map\u2019s platforming is somewhat tight and restrictive, but fairly easy. \u201cpaint\u201d - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a colorful and lively village. This map places emphasis on its story, as Madeline struggles with a work of art that she believes is not good enough and struggles to make it perfect; meanwhile, Badeline attempts to act as a voice of reason and urges her to take better care of herself. The map\u2019s platforming relies on more traditional game mechanics of moving platforms and dodging projectiles, set in time with the map\u2019s music. Due to the map\u2019s high-effort presentation, it is widely regarded to be the most iconic map in all of Strawberry Jam. \u201cRose Garden\u201d - A yellow beginner map which takes heavy inspiration from Super Mario Galaxy, particularly the gusty garden galaxy. The map\u2019s main mechanic, a holdable rose which acts as a parachute, giving Madeline an upwards boost whenever she presses the dash button, is also an idea borrowed from Super Mario Galaxy. \u201cTreehive\u201d - A yellow"}, {"chunk_id": 23, "text": "beginner map themed around a large beehive inside of a tree. The map\u2019s main mechanic is a particular variant of dream blocks, sometimes refered to as \u201choney blocks\u201d, which allow Madeline to reflect off of walls while inside, instead of dying when colliding with a wall. \u201cThe Squeeze\u201d - a yellow beginner map taking place in a dismal city. The map challenges the player to use the level geometry to line Madeline up to fall into several tight gaps. \u201cSoap\u201d - A red beginner map that takes place in a blue, bubbly environment. The main mechanics of this map are blue variants of entities found in the vanilla game, such as bubbles and springs, which, in their blue form, do not replenish Madeline\u2019s dash. This encourages the player to think twice about when and where to use their limited dashes. \u201cSwitchtube Vista\u201d - A red beginner map that takes place in a purple, retro city. Its main mechanics are pipes which function similarly to warp pipes from the Super Mario franchise, and switch blocks which toggle certain portions of the level between being on and off. The map is highly evocative of retro games from the NES era, as its mechanics, presentation, and music all appear to draw inspiration from retro Nintendo games. \u201cA Gift From the Stars\u201d - a red beginner puzzle map taking place in a forest at a UFO crash site. This map explores time-stopping mechanics to create infamously challenging puzzles. (aka \u201cagfts\u201d) \u201cStrawberry Orchard\u201d - A red beginner map that takes place on a ranch, as Madeline cartoonishly endeavors to steal a jar of the ranch\u2019s famous strawberry jam. This map primarily utilizes pipes, as well as a heavy throwable jar of jam that the player must navigate to the end of each screen. This map is considered to have the most challenging platforming of the beginner lobby. (aka \u201corchard\u201d) \u201c Dropzle \u201d - a red beginner puzzle map in which the player must use their finite number of dashes to align a series of Kevins in such a way that allows her to drop through a pixel perfect gap, hence \u2018 dropzle \u2019. Although it is possible, albeit challenging for most, to jump straight through the gap, it is discouraged by the map creator to do so. (Sometimes the term \u201cdropzle\u201d is also used to refer to pixel perfect gaps, in reference to this map.) \u201cCoresaken City\u201d - a red beginner map combining decoration and mechanics of Chapter 1, Forsaken City, and Chapter 8, Core. \u201cBlueberry Bay\u201d - the final challenge of the beginner lobby, Blueberry Bay is a beach-themed heartside with one flag dedicated to each of the maps in the beginner lobby. SJ Intermediate Lobby \u201cSleeping Under Stars\u201d - a green intermediate map similar to Farewell in design but utilizes low gravity throughout the map. \u201cFrosted Fragments\u201d - a green intermediate map that takes place in a frigid cave. It\u2019s main mechanics are blocks that the player can push to get further through the level or to obtain double dash refills and green boosters. \u201cFifth Dimension\u201d - a green intermediate map that is"}, {"chunk_id": 24, "text": "defaulted to two dashes, makes use of boosters that don\u2019t refill the player\u2019s dash, and uses wallbounces as its primary technique. \u201cLow-G Botany\u201d - missing description \u201cSpring Collab 2020\u201d - a large mod released in 2020. Prior to Strawberry Jam Collab, this was the largest and most well known Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSC2020\u201d, \u201cSpring Collab\u201d, or \u201cSC\u201d.)

(aka \"CMGV\") \u201c// MOCE //\u201d - MOCE is a two-map series by issyy containing the map \u201cMOCE // CPVL\u201d (aka \u201ccpvl\u201d) and \u201cMOCE // LXVI\u201d (aka \u201clxvi\u201d). These maps are both designed as extremely tight corridors lined with hazards that require the player to use precise tech to traverse. CPVL is designed horizontally, with the player moving rightwards, while LXVI is designed vertically, with the player moving upwards. The naming convention for these maps follows a pattern of two letters in a word being replaced with another random letter. \u2018moce\u2019 is nice, \u2018cpvl\u2019 is cave, and \u2018lxvi\u2019 is love. CPVL used to be called \u201cCPCL\u201d, which stood for cock , spelling out nice// cock . This change was made due to issyy wanting //MOCE// to be a serious campaign, and the joke name CPCL did not suit this tone. \"Shatter Site\" - a dashless map made by AstralightSky . This map is infamous for its gameplay, being unplaytested and requiring numerous precise techniques to complete. The map\u2019s setting is a variant on Chapter 2, Old Site. (The map is jokingly abbreviated as \"Shite\" due to its low reputation among the Celeste community.) \"Avian Ascension\" - the hardest gm+1 map in celeste made by the popular Celeste YouTuber parrot_dash . The map is based off of the 2500M checkpoint of the map \u2018D1D7\u2019 , resulting in mechanics and decoration from the Mirror Temple . It is the hardest 2* map on hardlist. (aka \"AA\", \u201cascension\u201d) \"Crystal Garden\" - A short map made by Etpio . This map has a storied history, with Parrot Dash being the first to clear it after routing it in secret. This was formally the easiest 3* map on hardlist, used as the standard to determine if a map belongs in the 2* or 3* category. Clears for hardlist are accepted for any version after v1.4 and before v1.6. (aka \"cg\") The second room of Crystal Garden (aka \u201ccg2\u201d) is by far the hardest in the map, being incredibly long and extremely complicated to route. The route used by Parrot Dash in his first clear was actually not the intended route, and has since been patched. It is rumored that nobody, not even"}, {"chunk_id": 34, "text": "the map\u2019s creator, knows the intended route to clear room 2. \"Madeline Votes in the 2020 US Presidential Election D-Side\" - A dashless map made by Jan. This is the final map in the \u201cMadeline votes in the 2020 US Presidential Election\u201d map pack, but is separate from the rest of the maps. This map is considered a joke, as the map is filled with crude dialogue and memes. This map is a lot harder than any other map in the pack, and is a 3* map on hardlist. (aka \"delection\" or \u201celection d\u201d ) \u201cD1D7\u201d - An extremely difficult etselec map of \u20187D1D\u2019 by fishtank_underflow. This map is a 3* on Hardlist, formerly the most difficult map cleared. One notable room in this map is: \u201c2k-3\u201d - A nickname for the 3rd room of the 2000m checkpoint in the original 7D1D. In D1D7, it is an insanely difficult dropper room with multiple, incredibly tight gaps, some being pixel-perfect, requiring near TAS-level movement down to the subpixels (see also, \u201cSubpixel\u201d and \u201cTool-assisted speedrunning\u201d). Formerly the most difficult room cleared in Celeste. \u201cDashless+\u201d - A buffed version of Chapter 1A, Forsaken City, which continues after the Forsaken City section into an original creation. It is a 3* map on Hardlist, (see also, \u2018hardlist\u2019,) and is currently considered the hardest custom map to ever be cleared. (aka \u201cD+\u201d). A particularly difficult room at the end is split into four segments, referred to by the community as \u201cQuarter 1\u201d, \u201cQuarter 2\u201d, \u201cQuarter 3\u201d, and \u201cQuarter 4\u201d, respectively. (aka \u201cQ1\u201d, \u201cQ2\u201d, \u201cQ3\u201d, and \u201cQ4\u201d.) This is widely regarded in the community as the hardest room ever cleared. (aka \u201cD+ final\u201d, \u201cD+24\u201d , or \u201c24\u201d) \u201cSuperfecta\u201d - Missing descriptor \u201c Flusheline Community Collab\u201d Missing Descriptor - (aka FLCC) Speedrunning Terminology Speedrunning is a style of playing a game with the goal of completing the game in as little time as possible, often competing against others for the best time. Below is a list of terms used in the Celeste community which are frequently, but not exclusively, used in the context of speedrunning the game, or other adjacent practices, such as deathless runs. \u201cDeathless\u201d - This refers to any challenge run or speedrun which requires no deaths throughout the entire playthrough. \u201cFull Clear\u201d - These runs entail playing through an entire chapter or custom map, or sometimes an entire collab or lobby, while collecting every strawberry, and the cassette and crystal heart if applicable. (aka \u201cFC\u201d) \u201cLow Death\u201d - A way of stating the lowest number of deaths you have gotten in a run of a particular map/checkpoint , generally used"}, {"chunk_id": 35, "text": "when practicing. For example, \u201cFW low death 12\u201d means that you have done a complete clear of Farewell in twelve deaths. \u201cRM low death 3\u201d would mean that you\u2019ve done the Remembered checkpoint from Farewell in three deaths. \u201cPersonal Best\u201d - A personal record for lowest deaths, lowest time, or most progress on a screen or map without dying is called a \u201cpersonal best\u201d or \u201cPB\u201d for short. \u201cSpeedrun Category\u201d - Speedruns of nearly every game, including Celeste, have multiple categories, which have different requirements for a speedrun to be valid. Below is a list of Celeste\u2019s main speedrun categories, taken from speedrun.com : [ba] \u201c100%\u201d - Complete all chapters, collect all 175 red berries, and collect the moon berry from a new file.

It simply requires the player to beat the main game.) \u201cBny%\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file without completing any A-Sides. \u201cTrue Ending\u201d - Complete Farewell from a new file. Some less common speedrun categories include: \u201c1-UP in Four Chapters\u201d - Obtain a 1-Up in four separate chapters.

This category has only ever been completed by runner \u2018Rickfernello\u2019. His video completing this challenge can be seen here. This category is not documented on speedrun.com. \u201cPre DLC\u201d - Complete all chapters available in patches before 1.3.0.0 from a new file. (This category serves mainly as an archive for Any% runs that occurred prior to the release of the Farewell DLC on December 9th, 2019.) \u201cPrologue\u201d - Complete Prologue from a new file. \u201cSave States\u201d - Save states (aka \u2018states\u2019) are a functionality which allows the player to reload a Celeste screen to a certain chosen point. They are commonly used in other games, especially modded games and emulators. They are especially used by modded Celeste players to practice hard screens, at a certain difficulty when it becomes harder to make progress without the use of save states. A \u201cdead state\u201d refers to when a player sets a save state at a point which is guaranteed to kill them, or that makes progress impossible. \u201cStateless\u201d is used to refer to when a player clears something without using save states. \u201cTool-assisted Speedrunning\u201d - A category of speedrunning where inputs are written by one or more people to be read back and performed in real time by a bot. This is also used outside of the Celeste community. Maps or challenges that are too difficult or impossible to be performed by a human, but can be performed by a bot, are referred to as \u201cTAS only\u201d. (aka \u201cTAS\u201d.) Community Resources Below is a list of Celeste\u2019s most frequented community resources. \u201cAhorn\u201d - A map making software for Celeste currently not being worked on. Its replacement, L\u00f6nn, is currently being worked on and actively improved. Because L\u00f6nn is not yet finished, some mappers may still prefer Ahorn. Ahorn is built into Olympus as a one button launch. \u201cCeleste\u2019s Hardest Maps Clear List\u201d - A collection of the most difficult (non TAS-only) custom Celeste maps that have been cleared by a human. Celeste's Hardest Maps Clear List can be found here. Maps on the hardlist are classified"}, {"chunk_id": 37, "text": "in terms of one star, two stars, and three stars, abbreviated as \u201c1*\u201d, \u201c2*\u201d, and \u201c3*\u201d, respectively [bb] . The more stars, the harder the map. ( aka \"hardlist\", \u201chist\u201d, \u201chlist\u201d, or \u201ch-list\u201d .) \u201cCeleste Discord\u201d - Celeste\u2019s official Discord server! This is the central hub of the Celeste community. They can be joined at https://discord.gg/celeste . (aka \" celestecord \" or \" clord \") \u201c Celestenet \u201d - An extremely popular Celeste mod that allows for some multiplayer connectivity, such as seeing other players in real time, grabbing them, or jumping off of their heads. The game world, such as the position of Theo or whether a falling block has fallen, is localized to each individual player. Account setup and download is available at https://celestenet.0x0a.de/ . \"Custom Map Golden Strawberry List\" - A collection of deathless runs achieved for various modded maps. The Custom Map Golden Strawberry List can be found here. Completed goldens and silvers of individual maps are placed into the Standard Golden List, which are a comparable difficulty to most vanilla goldens, or the Hard Golden List, which are above the difficulty of the Hell Trio. The Hard Golden List is also ranked in the Top Golden List, where the bottom, Tier 7, is for goldens/silvers just harder than the Hell Trio. Difficulty rises as the tier number descends, where Tier 0 is currently the hardest achieved golden. Farewell Golden serves as the bottom of Tier 3, and tiers 0-3 are also ranked by subcategories designated by the cell fill saturation. Maps easier than tier 3 are listed in tiers/subcategories in alphabetical order. Tiers are often abbreviated by \"T#\", where a Tier 4 golden would be referred to as a T4. (aka \"molden list\") \u201cEverest\u201d - The mod loader for Celeste, available on github or gamebanana . Everest is built into Olympus as a one button launch. \u201cGamebanana\u201d - A website for hosting a variety of games and mods. Gamebanana is the standard platform for hosting Celeste mods, although some are simply uploaded to Google Drive. \u201cL\u00f6nn\u201d - The map making software for Celeste, currently being worked on by several talented programmers. It is unfinished as of now, so mappers may still prefer Ahorn. L\u00f6nn is built into Olympus as a one button launch, though this is only accessible through the settings menu first. (aka \"Loenn\".) \"Olympus\" - A convenient GUI made for quick access to unmodified Celeste, Everest, Ahorn, L\u00f6nn, downloaded mods, Gamebanana, and more, available on github or gamebanana .. Community References Below is a list of references and inside jokes frequently used by the Celeste community. \u201c1170\u201d - An infamous death that circled around the celeste community for a while. This death features celeste player \u201cShye\u201d playing 2k3 [requires its own section, possibly under D1D7] in"}, {"chunk_id": 38, "text": "celeste map \u2018D1D7\u2019 (see also, \u2018D1D7\u2019) before passing the hardest gap at the end and not pushing any buttons to move into the final gap. This death is a meme due to the immense discord posts showcasing the death as a reaction. \u201cBonk\u201d - community term for when Madeline hits her head on an object, usually after a wall bounce. is used frequently outside of the Celeste community as well. \u201cBurgy\u201d - A cross between Kirby and a burger, which is a common emote in the Celeste Community, and often seen as a mascot. ( if anyone knows the origins feel free to add that [bc] ) \u201cCarwash\u201d - Sometimes used to refer to wavedashes or failed wavedashes, this term comes from the mod Celeste, Google Translated Edition where, during the wavedash tutorial presentation, the text \u201cWith Wavedashing, you can jump very far and regain your dash at the same time! \u201d is replaced with \u201c Carwash allows you to go through windows simultaneously.\u201d \u201cComf\u201d - short for \u2018comfy,\u2019 this is a community term for when Madeline crouches in a one-block high gap. \u201cFrogeline\u201d - One of the many emotes used in the Celeste Discord server, this emote is often used to celebrate or congratulate other users\u2019 accomplishments. It depicts Madeline as a frog with a gaping mouth. \u201cHell Trio\u201d - A community term for three golden strawberries in celeste, 6bg, 7bg, and 8bg, which were each considered collectively as the hardest challenges in the game prior to the release of the Chapter 9 update, when the Farewell golden strawberry became Celeste\u2019s pen ultimate challenge. These serve as the baseline for custom modded map goldens/silvers to be on the Hard Golden List. Disorganized and Miscellaneous Entries Any entries that have not yet been sorted or cannot be sorted into a specific category will go here. \u201c0 framed\u201d - (aka \u201c0f\u201d) A phenomenon which can happen due to the way Celeste calculates the position of a moving entity at any given moment. All movement in the game is tied to frames, and Celeste has a default frame rate of 60 frames per second. From one frame to another, the player\u2019s position, for example, is calculated to have been moved by a certain number of pixels, and they are never considered to be present in between those positions. This makes it possible to clip through hazards without interacting with them at high enough speeds, as there are zero frames where the hazard can interact with Madeline. An example of this phenomenon is hitting a spiked Kevin using a green booster. This also makes certain actions impossible at high speeds, since there are no frames where the player is in the correct position to perform said action. \u201cCollab\u201d - Collabs are packs of maps made by several map creators. (Collabs are all independent projects. Other similarly named collabs are not necessarily affiliated with one another. For example, Winter Collab 2021 is not affiliated with Spring Collab 2020.) \u201c Strawberry Jam Collab\u201d - A large mod released in 2023. (aka \u201cStrawberry Jam\u201d,"}, {"chunk_id": 39, "text": "\u201cSJ2023\u201d, or \"SJ\".) (Anything specifically associated with Strawberry Jam Collab will be given red text.) (See Custom Maps section below for more information!) \u201c Spring Collab 2020\u201d - A large mod released in 2020. Prior to Strawberry Jam Collab, this was the largest and most well known Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSC2020\u201d, \u201cSpring Collab\u201d, or \u201cSC\u201d.) (Anything specifically associated with Spring Collab 2020 will be given green text.) (See Custom Maps section below for more information!) \u201cSilver Strawberry\u201d - These are essentially the same as a golden strawberry, as they are obtained from completing the map without dying. They are often used in maps in collabs, as they represent that maps in collabs are often shorter than an average map. Similarly to goldens, silver strawberries are abbreviated with an \"S\" at the end, for example, Treehive Silver would be \"TreehiveS\". (aka \u201csilver\u201d) \u201cRainbow Strawberry\u201d - Spoilers for Spring Collab, Strawberry Jam, and other collabs and contests. These are obtained in certain collabs and/or contests, including Spring Collab and Strawberry Jam Collab, as a reward for collecting every silver strawberry in a lobby. \"Speed Berry\" - Appearing as a yellow strawberry with a clock, this strawberry serves as a speedrunning challenge for players. Speed Berries have bronze, silver, and gold times, which require increasingly optimized completions of the map. These appear in Spring Collab 2020 and a few other collabs. \"Alternate Sides\" - It is common for maps to indicate that they are simply a harder version of another map by following it with a letter, followed by the word \u201cside.\u201d This is an expansion of the B-Side and C-Side system of the vanilla game. This is most commonly done with D-Sides. \u201cDifficulty\u201d - Maps are generally categorized by difficulty. The five main difficulties are \u201cbeginner\u201d , \u201cintermediate\u201d , \u201cadvanced\u201d , \u201cexpert\u201d , and \u201cgrandmaster\u201d . (These are often abbreviated in order as beg/bg, int, adv, ex/exp, and gm) This difficulty delineation was popularized by Spring Collab 2020 and is the most widely used, including in Strawberry Jam. The difficulties, in comparison to vanilla Celeste, are as follows: Beginner : The same as most of the game\u2019s main story chapters (A-sides). Intermediate : Most of the game\u2019s B-sides and C-sides fall in this category. Advanced : Some of Celeste\u2019s most difficult rooms reach low advanced territory. Expert : Expert is beyond the difficulty of anything in vanilla Celeste. Grandmaster : Grandmaster is also well beyond the difficulty of anything in vanilla. In addition, c olors are used to denote the difficulties of maps found in these categories, green being the least difficult, yellow being in the middle, and red being the most difficult, indicated by an image of a meter. Additionally, maps that are notably harder than even the hardest GM maps are often referred to as GM+, and a cracked meter is used to represent these maps in"}, {"chunk_id": 40, "text": "collabs (see \u2018Cracked\u2019). \"Celestial\" - The term \u201cCelestial\u201d is a suggested alternative to the gm+x format to indicate maps which are harder than grandmaster, but it is not widely used by the Celeste community. \u201cCracked\u201d - Sometimes \u201ccracked red\u201d, these refer to maps given cracked difficulty, used in grandmaster maps to indicate maps that are beyond the typical spectrum of grandmaster difficulty. These maps are sometimes referred to as \u201cgm+\u201d. The number after \u2018gm+\u2019 indicates how many difficulty thresholds it is above a typical grandmaster level; for example, a gm+2 map is two difficulty categories above grandmaster, just like how advanced is two categories above beginner. Anything above gm+2 is seldom agreed upon. The term \u201ccracked\u201d comes from the fact that, in the difficulty color meter used in various collabs, the pointer is pushed so far to the right that it goes past red and causes the meter\u2019s glass cover to crack. \u201cLobby\u201d - A map made for selecting other maps, frequently used in collabs. These are often sorted by difficulty (e.g. expert lobby, beginner lobby, etc.) \u201cGym\u201d - Maps made solely for teaching techniques to players. These maps are common to include in collabs and are often sorted by difficulty, similarly to lobbies. \u201cHeart Side\u201d - a type of map frequently placed at the end of a lobby in a collab , popularized by Spring Collab. They are typically a collection of all the other maps in a lobby. These maps are typically longer and more difficult than others in its difficulty category. These are frequently given prefixes to indicate what difficulty they are: \u201cBHS\u201d for beginner, \u201cIHS\u201d for intermediate, \u201cAHS\u201d for advanced, \u201cEHS\u201d or occasionally \u201cEXHS\u201d for expert, and \u201cGMHS\u201d for grandmaster. Oftentimes the \"heart\" portion is replaced by another word, such as the Winter Collab 2021 Fusionside serving as that collab's heart side. \u201cDashless\u201d - Just as it sounds, these are maps or challenges that disallow Madeline from dashing. \u201cDark Map\u201d - Describes a decoration style that turns tiles and entities into dark silhouettes to contrast the background. (e.g., Crimson Night, Heaven\u2019s Outer Space) (aka \"Silhouette Map\") . This may also refer to maps which obscure the map until lit up, such as the depths subchapter of chapter 5A from vanilla Celeste. \u201cEtselec\u201d - Literally the word \u201cCeleste\u201d backwards, these maps are backwards versions of other maps, where rooms are completed in reverse order from end to beginning with minimal changes made to keep them possible. (See also, D1D7.) \u201cGarbage Version\u201d - Modified versions of existing maps, but spammed with the moving saw blade entity from chapter 5. These maps are typically abbreviated with \u201c GV\u201d at the end of their abbreviation. CMGV, for example, is a garbage version of the map Cycle Madness. Occasionally, Garbage"}, {"chunk_id": 41, "text": "Versions are made with the base of another Garbage Version, resulting in often TAS-only maps like CMGVGV and CMGVGVGV. \u201c Techspam\u201d - A style of gameplay that revolves around using lots of tech in quick succession, typically with high input density. Maps using this style are usually expert or higher in difficulty due to the nature of it. An example of this style is the map \u201cS.B.W.W.\u201d. \u201cSave and Quit\u201d (aka \u201cs+q\u201d, \u201cs&q\u201d, \u201cs and q\u201d, \u201csq\u201d)- Saving and quitting is an option in the Celeste pause menu. Selecting it brings the player to the main menu, wherein whenever they choose to continue, they will continue where they left off in a chapter. Saving and quitting counts as a death and removes the player\u2019s golden strawberry if they have one. \u201cDreadcorner\u201d - The name of a strategy in the chapter 5 B-side used to skip a portion of the chapter, performed by doing a spiked cornerjump on the right side of the room where Madeline would normally require using a red booster. It is called this, as it is the faster alternative to the \u2018bubsdrop\u2019 that can be performed in this room, but is much more difficult."}], "full_text": "Welcome to the Celeste Dictionary! \u00a0Project started by Marz to make understanding Celeste jargon easier for newer members of the community.\n\nUse the Find tool to find a particular term of interest.

Along with strawberries, each A-side has a collectable hidden cassette tape as well as a blue crystal heart which often requires puzzle-solving.  \u201cB-side\u201d - B-sides are an unlockable challenge version of a chapter, significantly more difficult than the A-side. B-sides are non-canon and have no collectable strawberries besides the ubiquitous golden strawberry. Each B-side ends with a collectable red crystal heart.  \u201cC-side\u201d - C-sides are the final unlockable \u2018side\u2019 of a chapter, and are harder than B-sides. Each C-side is generally three rooms long, with the final room being the most difficult, making C-sides the shortest chapters in Celeste. Like B-sides, they are non-canon and have no collectable strawberries. Each C-side ends with a collectable yellow crystal heart.\n\nPrologue and Epilogue are chapters without alternate sides or collectables, they aren't shown in the Journal, and they have no abbreviation, as they are very short and lack any significant challenge.\n\n\u201cCassette\u201d  - Every chapter A-side contains a collectable cassette found in a hidden room. These hidden rooms play a chip-tune music track in the background and have \u2018cassette blocks\u2019 which activate and deactivate in rhythm with the music. \u00a0Collecting a cassette unlocks the B-side of the chapter.\n\n\u201cCrystal Heart\u201d  - Floating heart shaped crystals with one found in each chapter. A-sides have blue crystal hearts, found somewhere hidden in the level. B-sides have red crystal hearts which serve as the end goal of the chapter. Likewise, C-sides have yellow crystal hearts which serve as the end goal of the chapter. A-Side and B-Side hearts are also individually named.\n\n\"Farewell\" \u00a0- Chapter 9 of Celeste added in a free DLC on September 9th, 2019. It is far longer and more difficult than all other chapters of Celeste, and requires at least 15 Crystal Hearts to access any content past the Remembered checkpoint. This requirement can be bypassed with some tech usage.  The golden strawberry for this chapter, abbreviated as \"FWG\", is widely regarded as the ultimate  challenge in Celeste. The final checkpoint of Farewell is called \u2018Farewell\u2019, and to avoid confusion, this checkpoint is referred to as \"Farewell/Farewell\" or \"FWFW\".\n\n\u201cStrawberry\u201d \u00a0- Strawberries are Celeste\u2019s main collectible. There are 175 main strawberries that count towards 100% completing the game, plus 27 extra strawberries that do not count towards this, for a final total of 202. \u00a0Collecting six of any of these in a short period will display consecutive 1000-point rewards, starting from 1000 and increasing up to 5000, and finally displaying the text \u20181-UP\u2019 along with giving the 1UP! achievement. These points and the 1-UP are purely cosmetic, and are a reference to retro-era video games such as Super Mario World. The various types of strawberries in Celeste include:\n\n\u201cRed Strawberry\u201d - The default strawberry type. Although the exact specific mechanics of these strawberries depends on the particular strawberry, most cannot be collected unless the player is standing on solid ground in a safe area. These strawberries count towards 100% completion. \u201cWinged Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cwinged berry\u201d) - The second most common strawberry type. These strawberries function the same as red strawberries, with the added caveat that the strawberry will attempt to fly away if the player dashes in the room in which it is contained. These strawberries count towards 100% completion.  \u201cSeeded Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cstrawberry seeds\u201d, \u201cseed berry\u201d)- To collect these strawberries, the player must collect a series of strawberry seeds within a room without touching the ground, which will result in the seeds returning to their position. If successful, a cutscene will play and the seeds will manifest as a collectable red strawberry. These strawberries count towards 100% completion.  \u201cGolden Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cgolden\u201d) - Each of Celeste\u2019s chapters, as well as their B-sides and C-sides, has one golden strawberry, requiring the player to complete the chapter without dying to obtain, with the exception of Prologue and Epilogue. A distinct death sound will play if the player dies while carrying a golden strawberry. Each strawberry is referred to by taking the chapter\u2019s acronym and adding the suffix \u2018G\u2019; so the golden strawberry of the Chapter 1 A-side is 1AG, Chapter 4 C-side is 4CG, and of Farewell is \u201cFWG\u201d. This applies for custom maps as well. Golden strawberries become available after the player completes the chapter 8 B-side. These strawberries do not count towards 100% completion.  \u201cWinged Golden Strawberry\u201d (aka \u201cwg \u201d or \u00a0\u201c1A dashless\u201d) - The only winged golden strawberry in the game appears at the end  of the chapter \u00a01 A-side. It can only be found if the player completes the full chapter without dashing, although the strawberry will reappear if the player dies in the same room they dashed in before completing the room. This is one of Celeste\u2019s most difficult collectibles, requiring niche techniques that are required nowhere else in the game, including corner jumps, a 6jump, and a 4-tile overhang. This strawberry does not count towards 100% completion. \u201cMoonberry\u201d (aka \u201cmb\u201d or, less commonly, \u201cmerry\u201d) - The only moonberry in the game sits in a hidden room within Farewell/Farewell, which can be entered if the player backtracks after clearing the electric fields. It appears as a green strawberry with a yellow \u2018Saturn ring\u2019 around it. Upon collecting it, the usual 1000 point indicator will be replaced with the flashing text \u201cWOW\u201d. \u00a0Due to one of the rooms leading to it requiring the player to reset their respawn point and die to clear the room, it is the only collectable in the game which is completely impossible to collect without dying. Due to this, dying here while holding the golden strawberry is the only point in the game where the player will not be sent back to the beginning of the chapter when they die.  This strawberry does not count towards 100% completion.\n\n\u201cVariants\u201d \u00a0- A special menu unlocked after completing the C-side of Chapter 8, Core. It allows the player to change various settings about gameplay, such as the speed of time in-game a h d the amount of dashes one has. The settings are separated into two groups: variants and assists. \u00a0A full list of the settings in the variants menu is found below:\n\nVariants\n\n\u201cGame Speed\u201d - Controls the speed of time in-game, which affects all movement,  sounds and visuals in a level, This does not affect the chapter and file timers. The default value for this variant is 100%. The minimum is 50% and the maximum is 160% \u201cMirror Mode\u201d - As its name implies, mirrors the screen in-game. Also changes the position of character portraits in dialogue boxes. \u201c360 Dashing\u201d  -  Missing Descriptor \u201cInvisible Motion\u201d - Madeline becomes invisible while moving, regardless if the player is holding the movement button s or not. \u201cNo Grabbing\u201d - Madeline cannot grab onto walls, which makes  climbjumping \u00a0impossible. Certain blocks, such as the move blocks in Chapter 4, can still be activated by holding the grab button. \u201cLow Friction\u201d - Greatly reduces Madeline\u2019s friction with the environment, making reducing her speed much more difficult. \u201cSuper Dashing\u201d - Doubles the duration of Madeline\u2019s dash and gives her the ability to control the direction of her dash during one. (Not to be confused with the technique of the same name.) \u201cHiccups\u201d - Madeline will start to hiccup every 1-2 seconds, causing her to be slightly launched upwards, even in mid-air. \u201cOther Self\u201d - Turns Madeline into  Badeline . Purely cosmetic variant.\n\nAssists\n\n\u201cInfinite Stamina\u201d - Gives madeline infinite energy to climb walls. \u201cAir Dashes\u201d - Changes the amount of dashes Madeline has at any time. The settings for this are  Default ,  2 \u00a0and  Infinite . \u201cDash Assist\u201d - When dashing, stops time while holding the dash button, allowing the player to precisely control the timing and direction of their dashes. \u201cInvincibility\u201d - Makes Madeline invincible against all hazards. She will bounce on top of voids without dying to them; blocks that try to crush her will become non-solid; And, if she dashes into a wall through a Dream Block, she will bounce into the opposite direction.\n\nVanilla Entities\n\nVanilla entities are any entities which can be found in vanilla Celeste.  Below is a list of vanilla entities.\n\n\u201c Badeline \u00a0Chaser\u201d \u00a0- Clones of  Badeline \u00a0that chase Madeline in Chapter 2, Old Site. They will be  2 \u00a0seconds behind Madeline and will copy her moves exactly, killing her if touched.\n\n\u201cBooster\u201d \u00a0- (aka \u201cbubble\u201d) Large bubbles that, shortly after being entered, launch the player in any direction they choose. There are two types of boosters:\n\nGreen:  Introduced in Chapter 4, they quickly launch the player in a chosen direction before popping, covering a distance similar to that of a dash. Red: \u00a0 Introduced in Chapter 5, they move in a chosen direction in a straight line indefinitely until they are popped by colliding with a solid or the player dashing out of them.\n\n\u201cCassette Bubble\u201d \u00a0- After collecting a cassette, a large bubble  envelops \u00a0Madeline and brings her back to the start of the room. These bubbles are also used in Chapter 9, Farewell when collecting the keys in the Power Source checkpoint, where it would be impossible to return without them. Additionally, cassette bubbles are often used for strawberries in custom maps. (not to be confused with \u201cBooster\u201d, which is nicknamed \u201cbubble\u201d)\n\n\u201cCore Block\u201d \u00a0- A block found in chapter 8, also known as Core. This block has two different abilities. It will launch the player if grabbed or landed on if it is in its lava state. However in its ice state it will crumble away.\n\n\u201cCore Switch\u201d \u00a0- A switch found in Chapter 8, that causes the level to turn from lava to ice state or vice versa. This has various effects, such as making  m adeline slide on the ground in ice mode, as well as entities such as core blocks and bumpers switching to a different variant.\n\n\u201cCrumble Block\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0Grey blocks found throughout the game, first in Chapter 1 that quickly \u201ccrumble\u201d after landing or climbing on them, causing them to become intangible. They quickly reform a short period after being broken, providing that no tiles are covering them.\n\n\u201cDream Block\u201d  - The starry black blocks from Chapter 2. If these are dashed into, Madeline will continuously move through the block in the direction she dashed until she exits the block or hits a wall, the latter of which kills her. Exiting a dream block returns Madeline\u2019s dash.\n\n\u201cDust Bunny\u201d  - The black and dark red creatures from Chapter 3, acting either as a static or moving obstacle.\n\n\u201cFeather\u201d \u00a0- A golden feather introduced in Chapter 6, Reflection. When collected, it allows Madeline to fly in any direction for 2 seconds. While not holding in any direction, she will move much more slowly. A feather will regenerate Madeline\u2019s dash, unless she dashes out of it early.\n\n\u201cFlag\u201d \u00a0- Respawn points denoted by the image of a flag, followed by a number. In the base game, they are used in Chapter 7, Summit, Sides A and B. They are also frequently used in mo d s. Flags typically  count down ; so the lower the number, the closer the player is to the end. Certain flags may be abbreviated as f#, for instance, Flag 2 as F2. (Not to be confused with the #F format, which indicates the number of frames in which an action can be completed. See \u2018Frame Perfect.\u2019)\n\n\u201cHeart Gate\u201d - \u00a0Large, blue walls of light with hearts on them, found on all sides of Chapter 8, Core, and halfway through Chapter 9, Farewell. They serve \u00a0The hearts indicate how many crystal hearts the player must collect to open the heart gate.\n\n\u201cJellyfish\u201d -  A large, parasol-shaped jellyfish introduced in Chapter 9, Farewell. When held, it will act like a parachute, greatly slowing Madeline\u2019s fall. Jellyfishes  disappear \u00a0when touching a seeker barrier (see below).\n\n\u201cKevin\u201d \u00a0- The moving blocks with angry faces introduced in Chapter 6, Reflection, are referred to as \u2018Kevins\u2019. They get this name from the fact that they got their voices from Kevin, a developer.\n\n\u201cKey\u201d \u00a0- Golden keys introduced in Chapter 3, Celestial Resort.. They are used to open locked doors and, therefore, are required to progress in a chapter. Once collected, the keys will follow Madeline around and will stay with her even if she dies.\n\n\u201cOshiro\u201d \u00a0- The owner of the Celestial Resort Hotel in Chapter 3 (Celestial Resort), who turns into the main boss of the level in Presidential Suite. He periodically dashes from the right side of the screen to attack Madeline. The player may jump on Oshiro\u2019s head when he is dashing, with mechanics similar to that of the snowball or seeker entities. \u00a0 Being near Oshiro when he is dashing causes the game to slow down and the visuals to briefly turn black and white.\n\n\"Refill\" \u00a0- Crystals that refill the player's dashes and stamina fully. The amount of dashes restored depends on the color and number of diamonds present. Green, singular crystals restore one dash, while pink, double crystals restore two. These can only be collected when the player lacks a dash or is flashing red due to having low stamina. Most of these will respawn after about two seconds when collected, but some will not respawn until dying or screen transitioning.\n\n\u201cSeeker\u201d \u00a0- The monsters from the ends of Chapter 5, Mirror Temple A-Side and B-Side are referred to as \u2018seekers\u2019. These can be bounced off of, activate touch switches, break certain blocks, and are blocked by shimmering white Seeker Barriers that the player can pass through.\n\n\u201cSeeker Barrier\u201d \u00a0- Transparent walls of light introduced in Chapter 5 which stop seekers from passing through them. They also cause any jellyfishes that touch them to  disappear .\n\n\u201cSpinners\u201d  - Balls of crystal spikes, often used as the main hazard in maps. The term \u2018spinner\u2019 originates from their name in the code, as they are called \u2018Static Crystal Spinners\u2019.\n\n\u201cSpinner Juice\u201d \u00a0- A nickname for a background substance that automatically fills the gaps between spinners when they are close enough. The substance is purely visual and does not kill you.\n\n\u201cSwap Block\u201d \u00a0- Blocks with a red circle in the middle found in Chapter 5, Mirror Temple. These will quickly move to another position when the player dashes, and will slowly return afterwards. They can be used to quickly gain momentum.\n\n\u201cTheo Crystal\u201d - \u00a0A large crystal containing Theo introduced in Chapter 5. When carrying him, Madeline will be weighed down, slowing her down and preventing her from dashing and climbing. If a Theo crystal falls into a death pit, he dies and causes Madeline to die with him. Certain doors exist which only open while Madeline is carrying a Theo crystal.\n\n\u201cTouch Switch\u201d \u00a0-  Often called \u201ccoins\u201d are t riggers that when interacted with can open switch gates, which are blocks that move when all touch switches are triggered.\n\n\"Zip Mover\" \u00a0- Blocks on conveyor belts found in Chapter 1, Forsaken City. These quickly move to the end of the conveyor when the player touches them, and can be used for fast momentum gain. (aka \"traffic block\")\n\nVanilla Techniques and Game Mechanics [a] [b] [c]\n\nTechniques, or \u201ctech\u201d for short, are certain actions the player can perform to achieve something. Game mechanics are any mechanic that informs the way Madeline and the environment interact; since the two are inextricably linked, they are listed together. Below is a list of techniques and mechanics that exist  within the vanilla game. [d]\n\n\u201c5jump\u201d  - Grabbing the side of a block above spikes just above where she can hang onto the block will cause Madeline to be repositioned lower down. Doing another  climbjump \u00a0before this happens will allow Madeline to jump from slightly higher than she normally can, crossing a larger gap. Normally she can only cross a four tile long row of spikes, but with this technique, she can cross five, hence \u201c5jump.\u201d\n\n\" 6jump \" \u00a0- A dashless  cornerboost , done by approaching the top corner of a tile with walking speed, then  climbjumping \u00a0off of it for additional speed. With this, the player can cross a 6-tile gap of spikes.\n\n\u201c 7jump \u201d  - A  dashless \u00a0double  cornerboost , done the same way as a 6jump, but pressing a second jump button shortly after the first and beginning slightly lower on the wall to account for this.\n\n\"8jump\" \u00a0- A very difficult tech involv ing the same tech as a 7jump, but starting with +40 speed from a ground jump, and with a third  non-cornerboosting \u00a0 climbjump \u00a0added on. This  cornerboost \u00a0 will give +0 speed, but is required for gaining slightly more height. If starting an 8jump with more speed, the third  climbjump \u00a0may not be required. This mechanic is extremely precise, being subpixel dependent. (see also, \u2018subpixels\u2019.)\n\n\u201c9jump\u201d -  wallboost into dcb 4 frame perfect lmao wtf\u2026 this actually fucking exists [f]\n\n\u201c10jump\u201d \u00a0-\n\n\u201c11jump\u201d -\n\n\u201cArc Ultra\u201d  -\n\n\u201cArchie\u201d  - Entering a booster in a crouched state causes the position of the booster to shift upwards  slightly, as if Madeline is uncrouching within the bubble.  This has applications in speedrunning and hard clears. It\u2019s named after a little green parrot named Archie!  [g]\n\n\u201cBackboost\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cbboost\u201d) - When throwing a holdable, you gain a small speed boost in the opposite direction of the throw (8 0 speed ). In this technique, you must quickly turn around to throw the holdable behind you then turn back around. Spend as little time as possible moving in the direction of the throw to minimize speed loss and make use of the backboost.\n\n\u201cBino Clip\u201d \u00a0- Binoculars can be used to scroll the camera to the side and unload spinners. Ending the interaction does not cause the camera to return immediately, so this slight delay can be used to pass through unloaded spinners before they load.\n\n\u201cBino Control Storage\u201d \u00a0- In rare circumstances, for example skipping a cutscene while interacting with a bino, it is possible to cancel the dummy state that binoculars give you without canceling the interaction entirely. This results in being able to have control of Madeline while also controlling the camera using the binoculars. This is usually used in combination with spinner unloading, because spinners won\u2019t be loaded if they are outside of the camera.\n\n\u201cBino Interaction Storage\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cbino storage\u201d)- Interacting with binoculars for exactly one frame and jumping on the next frame tricks the game into thinking that Madeline is interacting with the binoculars when she is not. One of the consequences of this is that a dash through a screen transition gets canceled, which means that performing a grounded ultra through a screen transition allows the 1.2x speed boost to be retained past the end of the dash.\n\n\u201cBlock Boost'' \u00a0- (aka \u201cblockboost\u201d) - There is a brief  nine -frame window where after letting go of a moving block, such as a zip mover, where Madeline can  perform a wall jump off of the block and gain momentum . (Not to be confused with \u2018liftboost\u2019, a game mechanic that enables block boosts to be performed.)\n\n\u201cBoost Holdable Storage\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0 Releasing grab while holding a throwable when getting a boost from a fish or bumper causes a strange state to occur where Madeline acts for a short time as if she isn\u2019t holding a throwable, while visually she is. Madeline can dash in this state while seemingly holding the throwable (see \u201cThrowable Dash\u201d). If grabbed, Madeline does a pickup animation, and then the Madeline will be in the regular throwable grab state. If not grabbed, or Madeline does not dash, the throwable is thrown/dropped automatically after a short time after the boost. This tech was popularized by the strawberry room, \u201cExtra Ball\u201d in Pinball Purgatory, an infamous map from the strawberry jam collab.  (aka \u201cExtra ball tech\u201d, \u201ceb tech\u201d, \u201cFreeze Frame Ungrab\u201d, \u201cbumper ungrab\u201d)\n\n\u201cBubble Super/Hyper\u201d \u00a0- Dashing into a bubble (called a \u2018booster\u2019 in game files) from a grounded state allows you to input a super or hyper immediately as you enter the bubble and jump from the bubble as though it were solid ground.\n\n\u201cBubsdrop\u201d \u00a0- A bubsdrop is a technique used to immediately enter a downwards screen transition after entering a room from below, by doing a short jump as you enter the room to gain less height than the screen transition would give. This is notable in the chapter 5 B-side, as it allows the player to skip a portion of the chapter by resetting the player\u2019s respawn point.  This video \u00a0showcases an example of this phenomenon. (see also, \u2018 dreadcorner \u2019)\n\n\u201cBuffer\u201d \u00a0- A game mechanic present in many modern video games where if you input the controls to perform an action before your character is able, the game will read the input and perform the action as soon as it is able. In Celeste, for example, pressing the jump button shortly before coming in contact with the ground will still result in a jump. Most inputs can be buffered up to 5 frames, notable exceptions are buffering a pause out of a pause (6 frames) and grab/ slow fall \u00a0which can be buffered infinitely.\n\n\u201cBumper Boost\u201d \u00a0- Holding the direction away from a bumper while colliding with it will cause Madeline to be propelled away at a much higher speed and distance. Holding the direction towards the bumper will have the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cBumper Clip\u201d \u00a0-  After hitting a bumper, the player can dash towards the bumper and move through it, due to a lack of collision while the bumper is inactive. Performing this technique requires the player to initially contact the bumper at a precise angle. This tech is famously explored in the map \u2018Pinball Purgatory\u2019 from the Strawberry Jam Collab. (aka \u201cphase\u201d ,  \u201cbumper phase\u201d , \u201cblip\u201d )\n\n\u201cBunny Hop\u201d \u00a0- Performing short jumps in quick succession allows you to move faster than walking speed. Performing bunnyhops also allows the player to reduce loss of momentum. (aka \u201cbunnyhop\u201d or \u201cbhop\u201d)\n\n\u201cCassette Boost\u201d \u00a0- Jumping off of a cassette block within the first frame of it being active causes the jump to gain extra height.\n\n\u201cCassette Raise\u201d \u00a0- Remaining inside a cassette block while it activates and deactivates causes it to move upwards by two pixels. This can be repeated indefinitely to move a cassette block upwards vertically, provided you have the means to remain inside the cassette block for the required time period.\n\n\u201cCassette Boosted Feather Super\u201d \u00a0- This refers to a niche technique involving performing a jump using the momentum of exiting a feather while on an activating cassette block. Due to its specificity, it has very little application in gameplay. This tech is most often referred to humorously due to its convoluted abbreviation.  This video \u00a0showcases an example of this phenomenon.  \u00a0 (aka \u201ccassoosted fuper\u201d)\n\n\u201cCeiling Pop\u201d \u00a0- (aka \u201ccpop\u201d) When Madeline is at the bottom pixel of a wall, she can go under the wall and seemingly climbjump under the wall, hitting her head on the ceiling (hence why it\u2019s called a \u2018ceiling pop\u2019).  This technique is extremely precise, requiring frame-perfect timing and extremely precise positio ning down to less than a pixel.  (see also, \u2018frame perfect\u2019 and \u2018subpixels\u2019.) \u00a0 \u00a0 Cpops can also be performed off of spiked walls, requiring precision all the way down to a tenth of a pixel,  referred \u00a0to as \u201cspiked ceiling pops\u201d .\n\n\u201cCeiling Pop Cornerboost\u201d  - (aka \u201cpopcorn\u201d) A tech combining ceiling pops and corner boosts. This is achieved by performing a ceiling pop with enough horizontal speed to get a corner boost under the block. [h]\n\n\u201cCeiling Pop Cornerboost Wallboost\u201d - \u00a0(aka \u201cpopcornwob\u201d) \u00a0 A tech combining ceiling pops, corner boosts, and wallboosts. This is achieved by performing a ceiling pop cornerboost (see above), then switching directions to cancel horizontal speed with a wallboost. This can be used to jump under a block and grab onto the other side without dashing in highly specific situations.  [i]\n\n\u201cChained Ultra\u201d \u00a0- Performing several ultras in sequence will give Madeline an exponentially increasing speed boost. (aka \"Chultra\", \u201cChultras\u201d)\n\n\u201cClimb Boosting\u201d \u00a0-  This tech refers to gaining liftboost from a moving block that Madeline cannot grab. To do this, Madeline must do a wall jump from the block while holding grab. Holding grab allows Madeline to get the liftboost even when she cannot grab the block.  [verify]\n\n\u201cClimbhop\u201d  - Climbing onto the top of a platform causes Madeline to perform a small hop.\n\n\u201cClimbhop Cancel\u201d  -  Dashing during a climbhop on a moving object allows Madeline to retain the speed of the moving object into the dash, even if the dash is in a different direction to the block\u2019s movement . This has strange consequences, even including allowing the player to move through spikes under particular circumstances.  [j] \u201cClimbhop Cancel Ceiling Pop Cornerboost Wallboost Delayed Ultra\u201d -  (aka \u201cclobpopcornhob dultra\u201d)  \ud83d\udc80 what the fuck\n\n\u201cClimbhop Entanglement\u201d  - This niche technique allows the player to \u2018entangle\u2019 their momentum with a moving block without being in contact with that block. By canceling the animation Madeline does when climbing up to the top of a tile, which can be done (not exclusively) with a dash,  then by resetting Madeline\u2019s forced x by jumping off of other walls in intervals of 12 frames or less [k] , or hitting springs in intervals of 18 frames or less, Madeline\u2019s momentum will remain \u2018entangled\u2019 with the block.  This means that, as long as the block remains moving, its momentum will be applied to Madeline. If the block changes direction or stops moving, Madeline\u2019s momentum will also reflect this.  [l]\n\n\u201cClimbjump\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cclimb jump\u201d) - While holding a wall, jumping while holding the direction towards the wall or upwards will result in a climbjump. This will consume 27.5 units of stamina,  one quarter \u00a0of Madeline\u2019s maximum stamina.\n\n\u201cCoffee Jump\u201d \u00a0- A coffee jump is simply a corner jump performed off of a one tile overhang, starting from a wall. It is performed by pressing the jump button twice in rapid succession, more easily with two jump keys. It is called the coffee jump, as it is a required technique for the winged golden strawberry in the chapter 1 A-side, on the screen that has a caf\u00e9 in the background.\n\n\u201cCore Super\u201d / \u201cCore Hyper\u201d \u00a0- Performing a Super or Hyper dash during a brief window as a core block is destroyed allows Madeline to super or hyper dash with the added momentum of the core block.\n\n\u201c Cornerboost \u201d \u00a0(aka \u201c coost \u201d, \u201ccboost\u201d or \"cb\") -  Climbjumping \u00a0into the top corner of a tile with some momentum will give a small speed boost. The speed boost will only apply if Madeline inputs a jump prior to grabbing the wall. This is particularly useful as a means of  canceling \u00a0a dash and keeping the dash speed beyond the usual  duration \u00a0of the dash (like a Super Dash). Note that, although niche, a cornerboost can also be  performed off of the bottom corner of a wall if the wall is moving vertically upwards with high enough speed, as this means that the wall will be above Madeline during the jump portion of the cornerboost meaning that she will avoid colliding with it .\n\n\u201cCornerboost Wallboost\u201d \u00a0- A wallboost from a cornerboost. This entails performing a cornerboost with a neutral climbjump (without holding horizontally) and then holding away from the direction climb jumped. Notably, this can instantly remove high amounts of speed due to the properties of a wallboost.  (aka \u201ccobwob\u201d, \u201cwoosted coost\u201d, \u201ccornerboosted wallboost\u201d)\n\n\u201cCornerslip\u201d \u00a0-  Coming within 1 pixel vertically of a platform without landing on the platform  allows Madeline\u2019s dash to be refilled without resetting vertical speed. This is often (incorrectly) referred to as a \u2018jasig jump\u2019 as it often occurs when performing the speedrun strategy \u2018jasig\u2019.\n\n\u201cCorner Correction\u201d \u00a0- A leniency mechanic in which jumping or dashing into the corner of a  solid surface in a given direction causes Madeline to automatically move around the corner instead of getting stopped by it. For example, jumping or dashing upwards into a corner on a ceiling will cause Madeline to move around the corner as long as she is, at most, 4 pixels away from the corner and moving towards the ceiling, which makes techniques such as wallbouncing more lenient.\n\n\u201cCorner Jump\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201ccjump\u201d) - Jumping off of  the  corner of a block will result in a wall jump. . (Sometimes it is referred to as \u201c cump \u201d, though this abbreviation is often avoided due to sounding suggestive.)\n\n\u201cCorner kick\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cckick\u201d)- Jumping into the corner of a block from underneath, then jumping again once the block is crossed, will allow Madeline to wall jump off of the corner. ( Corner Jumps and Corner Kicks are not to be confused. )\n\n\u201cCoyote Time\u201d \u00a0- Coyote time refers to the game allowing certain actions to be performed after they should technically no longer be possible. Jumping a few frames after walking off of a ledge will still result in a jump, for instance.  Coyote time is responsible for making various other techniques possible, including dream hypers/supers and core supers/hypers. \u00a0Like buffering, coyote time is a feature of various other games; in Celeste the window for coyote time is five frames. The mechanic\u2019s name is a reference to Wile E. Coyote, a character from Looney Tunes.\n\n\u201cDash\u201d \u00a0- One of the basic actions the player can perform. By holding a direction and pressing Dash, the player can dash in one of eight directions. By default, Madeline can only do this once. Afterwards she must regain the dash by touching the ground, collecting a refill, interacting with an entity, or entering a screen transition. When Madeline has one dash, her hair is red; when she has no dashes, her hair is light blue, and when she has two dashes, her hair turns pink and floaty.\n\n\u201cDash Attack\u201d  - A leniency mechanic wherein there is  a 5 frame window [verify] \u00a0after a dash ends \u00a0in which dash-activated entities, such as dream blocks and kevin blocks, can still be activated. [m]\n\n\u201cDash Bounce\u201d \u00a0- Dashing within 2 frames of inputting a wallbounce gives you a slight vertical bump when the dash ends. This is because the game applies a constant vertical speed to Madeline for 17 frames when doing a wall bounce, whereas Madeline\u2019s dash lasts for 15 frames. (aka \u201cdashbounce\u201d, \u201cdounce\u201d, or sometimes \u201cshaboingboing\u201d.)\n\n\u201cDash Redirection\u201d -  When dashing, the game freezes for 3 frames. During this period, [n] \u00a0the player can change the direction of their dash. This is what allows crouch dashes to be performed manually, as when dashing dowards, Madeline crouches, and when redirecting a downwards dash into another direction, she stays crouched.\n\n\u201cDash Trigger\u201d \u00a0- Missing Descriptor; include information on Dash Trigger Skip (DTS) [o]\n\n\u201cDelayed Block Boost\u201d \u00a0- A block boost may still be performed if the player is no longer in contact with the block, instead wall jumping off of another surface within the nine-frame window of being in contact with the block. This phenomenon is rarely called a \u201cdelayed block boost\u201d, though sometimes it is just referred to as a block boost.  This video \u00a0showcases an example of this phenomenon.  (aka \u2018momentum carry\u2019) [p]\n\n\u201cDelayed Ultra\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cdultra\u201d) -  Canceling a diagonal down dash before the dash ends and before touching the floor gives Madeline the 1.2x speed boost from the ultra  the next time she contacts the floor , essentially storing the speed boost to be used later. Canceling the dash can be achieved in several ways, including  climbjumping \u00a0during the dash or entering a feather.\n\n\u201cDemo Dash\u201d  (aka \u201cdemo\u201d) - Crouching while dashing horizontally will preserve the crouched hitbox while dashing. This action can be mapped to a single input in the controls menu. This has a wide variety of implications, including allowing the player to squeeze through gaps they normally can\u2019t.  Demos cannot be performed if the player is in air and crouching and will instead cause the player to uncrouch immediately, which also means that a demo dash cannot be buffered out of another demo dash \u00a0like normal dashes can. \u00a0(aka \u201ccrouch dash\u201d)\n\n\u201cDemo Hyper\u201d -  Dashing diagonally downward, followed by a jump, will result in a hyper dash. However, the player can perform a hyper dash by demo dashing horizontally as well. This is called a \u2018demo hyper\u2019. Demo hypers have some additional utility compared to normal hypers; they can give more distance due to the dash extending slightly further, as well as allowing players to  perform the technique in midair \u00a0or on dream blocks, for instance. (see also, \u2018midair super\u2019).\n\n\u201cDeleting Madeline Safely\u201d  -  Missing Descriptor (??????)\n\n\u201cDouble  Cornerboost \u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cdcb\u201d) - Performing two  cornerboosts \u00a0on the same tile, often by using two jump buttons in quick succession. (not to be confused with  \u2018Depths Cornerboost\u2019 [speedrunning trick, needs entry] , which also uses the acronym \u2018dcb\u2019)\n\n\u201cDream Boost\u201d  (aka \u201cdroost\u201d) - When Madeline exits a dream block, the minuscule boost she gets from it is called a \u201cdream boost\u201d. This mechanic is most often referred to in the context of the niche \u2018splipped droost\u2019 technique. (see \u2018splipped droost\u2019) [q]\n\n\"Dream Double Jump\" \u00a0-  Pressing jump \u00a0just before exiting a dream block, and again in the coyote time  given from exiting a dream block will cause a jump that has more distance/height than a normal dream jump . This is because a jump adds 40 horizontal speed, so the second jump would both add another 40 speed on top of the first, as well as having slightly more height than a normal dream jump would. (aka \"ddj\")\n\n\u201cDream Grab\u201d \u00a0- While exiting a dream block from a side, hold the grab button and the opposite direction of movement to cling onto the edge of the dream block.\n\n\u201cDream Grab Hyper\u201d -  a player can perform a hyper out of a dream block within five frames of exiting the dream block, even if they perform a dream grab first. This is particularly useful with Theo (see \u2018theohyper\u2019).\n\n\u201cDream Hyper/Super\u201d \u00a0- Inputting a hyper/super during the five-frame coyote time window given after exiting a dream block will give the height and distance of a hyper/super dash, but will consume the player\u2019s dash. (see also, \u2018coyote time\u2019) Dream hypers cannot be performed if the player enters the dream block crouched or vertically. (aka \u201cdryper\u201d)\n\n\u201cDream Jump\u201d \u00a0- Press Jump while exiting the dream block to jump out of the dream block. This works in all directions. There are a total of 13 frames for this, 5 buffer frames, 3 freeze frames and then 5 coyote frames. (See also, \u2018Coyote Time\u2019.) You cannot Dream Jump if you  enter \u00a0the block vertically.\n\n\u201cDream Smuggle\u201d  - By dashing into a dream block and grabbing an object right before entering it, Madeline can carry held objects while dashing through Dream Blocks. Although this technique is technically vanilla, it has no practical use. It has more prevalence in custom Celeste maps. (aka \u201csmuggle\u201d, \u201cdream smuggle\u201d)\n\n\u201cExtended Super/Hyper\u201d \u00a0- Performing a super or hyper and waiting 10 frames before jumping will return Madeline\u2019s dash. \"Extended\" is sometimes shortened to \"ex\" or \"ext\".\n\n\u201cFailed Neutral\u201d \u00a0- A term used to refer to jumping away from a wall and immediately steering back towards it without performing a neutral, which loses a small amount of height on the wall. This is generally only used to set up a consistent subpixel positioning for other techniques, such as demos.\n\n\u201cFast Bubble\u201d \u00a0- Pressing Dash while in a bubble will cause the bubble to move in a direction sooner than usual. (aka \u201cfastbubble\u201d, or \"fubble\")\n\n\u201cFast Fall\u201d  - While falling, holding down will  make you fall much faster . \u00a0Madeline\u2019s sprite appears to narrow while fastfalling . [r]\n\n\u201cFeather Bounce\u201d  - This refers to when a player bounces off of a wall to change directions quickly, usually doing a 180 degree turn.\n\n\u201cFeather Clip\u201d \u00a0-  Using a feather against the top of a jump-through platform will allow Madeline to clip through the platform.  You must be holding down against the jump through when the feather expires.  [s]\n\n\u201cFeather Super\u201d  - Jumping along a solid surface while in the feather state will result in a longer, faster jump akin to a Super Dash. (see also \u2018Super Dash\u2019) (aka \u201cfuper\u201d, more often used in \u2018cassoosted fuper\u2019).\n\n\u201c Forced x \u201d \u00a0- This game mechanic temporarily forces a player to move in a specific direction for a certain number of frames. For example, a player is locked into moving right for 12 frames after performing a rightward wall jump.\n\n\u201cFrame Perfect\u201d  - These are a category of maneuvers that can only be performed on one single frame. Frames are the smallest increment of time in a video game. Celeste runs at 60 Frames per second, so each frame is one sixtieth of a second. The format for abbreviating these maneuvers is the number of frames in which a maneuver can be executed, followed by F. So for one frame maneuvers, the abbreviation is 1F. (Not to be confused with F#, which indicates a flag or checkpoint. See \u2018Flag.\u2019 Also not to be confused with  \u20182f\u2019, an April Fools map by Ellis Vesper which requires its own section under custom maps.) [t]\n\n\u201cFreeze Frame\u201d  - While interacting with certain mechanics or performing certain actions, such as bubbles or bumpers, t he game will briefly stop . (aka \u201cFF\u201d.)\n\n\u201cGrabless  Dream Hyper\u201d  (aka Mickey Mouse?)  Missing Descriptor\n\n\u201c Grounded Ultra\u201c \u00a0- A down diagonal dash that collides with the ground before the dash ends. These can be chained by wavedashing out of the first down diagonal dash, then quickly dashing in the same direction again. Colliding with the ground out of the down diagonal dash will still provide a 1.2x speed boost, but the speed boost will not persist after the dash ends. This is the fastest method of travel across flat ground. (aka \"Gultra\",  \u201cGultras\u201d )\n\n\u201cGrounded Wallboost\u201d \u00a0- A niche technique involving performing a wallbo st shortly before \u00a0being grounded . This is done by grabbing a wall at the  highest point [u] , doing a short hop \u00a0neutral climbjump, holding towards the wall, and then wallboosting, usually followed by a coyote jump off the ground. Often, a cornerslip is performed after the wallboost to get the coyote jump from lower down.  (aka \u201cgwoost\u201d.)\n\n\u201cHalf Stamina Climb\u201d \u00a0- A technique done by doing neutral climb jump, followed by a wallboost and  the \u00a0a climbjump up to 2 frames after the wallb ost (sometimes must be 1f after due to subpixels). This results in a jump from the wall with less speed, since the climb jump acts as a reverse cornerboost, reducing speed by 40. Only the second of the two climbjumps uses up stamina (since the wallboost refunds the first climbjump\u2019s usage), hence the name.  (More detail on where an nrcb is used may or may not be useful) [v]\n\n\u201cHeart Ultra\u201d \u00a0- Dashing down diagonally at the exact moment Madeline bounces off a crystal heart allows her to collect it while maintaining the momentum of the bounce through the down diagonal dash. \u00a0By spending Madeline\u2019s dash before attempting to perform this technique, making use of buffering, this technique can be performed more leniently. This technique is usually only performed for flavor, but is sometimes useful. This tech can also be used to collect a heart, then cancel the  heart collect by \u00a0entering a screen transition. (aka \u201chultra\u201d)\n\n\u201cHoldable Climbjump\u201d  - Repeatedly neutral dropping a holdable object,  climbjumping \u00a0up the wall and picking up the object allows Madeline to scale a wall while still having the object. (aka \u201ctheo climb\u201d, \u201cjelly climb\u201d)\n\n\u201cHoldable Dash\u201d  - Dashing while in a holdable storage state . This allows madeline to dash after a boost while seemingly holding a holdable, by releasing grab when getting the boost. (see \u2018Boost Holdable Storage\u2019. Note that this tech may also be called  extra ball tech.)\n\n\u201cHoldable Lift\u201d -  Throwing a held object at a wall, then dashing up into the object while holding Grab as it rebounds off of the wall, will allow the player to gain some height with a held object. It is most easily and effectively performed with jellyfish, but can be performed with heavy objects as well. (not to be confused with \u2018jellyvator\u2019, \u2018theovator\u2019, \u2018jelly regrab\u2019, or \u2018jelly ladder\u2019.) [w]\n\n\u201cHyper Bunny Hop\u201d  - Performed by following up a hyper dash with a tiny jump, followed by a full jump, this technique allows Madeline to gain significantly more height and momentum than a hyper dash. (aka \u201chyper bunnyhop\u201d, \u201chyper bhop\u201d, or less commonly, \u201chbhop\u201d.)\n\n\u201cHyper Dash\u201d \u00a0- Following a down-diagonal dash on the ground with a Jump will result in a high-speed, low-height jump. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to performing a dash. (aka \u201chyper\u201d)\n\n\u201cInstant Hyper\u201d  - This tech refers to performing a hyper  with little delay between the dash and the jump.\n\n\u201cInstant Super\u201d  - This tech refers to performing a super  with little delay between the dash and the jump.\n\n\u201cJelly Bump\u201d \u00a0- Holding jump when grabbing a jellyfish at speed will cause the jellyfish to boost upwards, even when dashing downright or down into the jellyfish.  [x]\n\n\u201cJelly Juggle\u201d  - This does not refer to a particular technique, but when the player has multiple jellyfish around them and switches between them, it is called \u2018juggling\u2019.  [y]\n\n\u201cJelly Ladder\u201d  -  Having upwards momentum while repeatedly grabbing and neutral dropping two jellyfish allows Madeline to infinitely gain height by exploiting the upward boost from grabbing a jellyfish. Slowfalling makes this tech  more lenient to perform.\n\n\u201cJelly Neutrals\u201d  - Repeatedly neutral dropping a jelly, neutral jumping off the wall and picking up the jelly allows Madeline to ascend a wall while retaining a jelly and not using stamina (see \u2018Neutral jumps\u2019). Note that you can also do this by gliding back to the wall using the jelly, but that requires a lot more horizontal space than is often available. This is not to be confused with holdable  climbjumping .\n\n\u201cJelly Regrab\u201d \u00a0- Throwing a Jellyfish while in midair, then immediately diagonal dashing back into it, will allow you to gain some extra height and distance from the jellyfish. Regrabbing a jellyfish can be performed horizontally, as well, if starting from a neutral drop. If done vertically, it is instead called \u2018jellyvator\u2019. Regrabs can also be performed on heavier objects, such as Theo\u2019s crystal, but this is much more difficult and sometimes requires the player to dash more than once to catch the object.\n\n\u201cJellyvator\u201d \u00a0- Neutral dropping from a jellyfish then dashing up into the jellyfish while holding Grab allows the player to gain some height while holding the jellyfish. This technique is similar to \u2018holdable lift\u2019, but does not require a nearby wall to perform the technique. When done with a heavier object, such as Theo\u2019s crystal, it is called \u201ctheovator\u201d. (not to be confused with \u2018jelly regrab\u2019 or \u2018holdable lift\u2019.)\n\n\u201cKermit Dash\u201d  - \u00a0 Missing Descriptor\n\n\u201cKoral \u00a0Skip \u201d  -  When Madeline is pushed against the border of a screen by certain entities, including Kevins or zip movers, Madeline will \u2018teleport\u2019 to the other side of the entity. This is called Koral Skip, \u00a0 I think, for some reason. Need verification . [z]\n\n\u201cLaunch Dash Redirect\u201d -  Missing Descriptor\n\n\u201cLava Neutral\u201d - \u00a0 The player can neutral off of lava and ice with frame perfect timing. [aa]\n\n\u201cLava Wall Jump\u201d \u00a0-  The player can also walljump off of lava with frame perfect timing.\n\n\u201cLiftboost\u201d  - This is a game mechanic that applies the speed of a moving block onto Madeline. There is a  nine -frame window where Madeline can gain a boost in momentum from a moving block, even after she is no longer touching the block or if the block stops moving. (Not to be confused with \u2018block boost\u2019, a technique that utilizes the mechanic liftboost.)\n\n\u201cLow Speed Ultra\u201d \u00a0-  When you start a down diagonal dash toward the ground, too high to initiate a wavedash, then jump with the slight extra speed of that dash. This is \u00a0normally an ultra, but if performed with no initial speed boost, this ultra will result in a minimal gain in speed, which cannot be used to chain speed boosts. (see the buffering section in  \u2018 Ultras and You \u2019 ).  (These may also be referred to as a  \u201c Failed Wavedash\u201d . This term is rarely used, due to its misleading or confusing name, given that there are several ways to \"fail\" a wavedash. \u00a0(aka \u201cfyper\u201d, \u201cfailed hyper\u201d or \u201ccarwash\u201d) [ab]\n\n\u201cMidair Hyper\u201d \u00a0- Starting in midair, demo dashing while level with some ground and jumping when reaching that ground will have Madeline perform a hyper dash. To avoid confusing these with wavedashes, they are often called \u201cmidair demo hypers\u201d or simply \u201cdemo hypers\u201d. (see also \u2018demo hyper\u2019, and \u2018wavedash\u2019.)\n\n\u201cMidair Super\u201d  - Starting in midair, dashing while level with some ground and jumping when reaching that ground will have Madeline perform a super dash.\n\n\u201cMoonboost\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0 Performing a super dash or demo hyper into the top three pixels of a moon block will push the moon block while simultaneously correcting the player to be on top of the moon block due to corner correction, resulting in a speed boost not possible on normal terrain. (See also, \u2018moon block\u2019 and \u2018corner correction\u2019.) (aka \u201cmoost\u201d)\n\n\u201cMultiboost\u201d \u00a0-  A technique where multiple boosts are gained from a block in quick succession, possible because of the properties of liftboost. There are many different ways to gain multiple block boosts, but the most common and easiest is to jump from a moving block and then immediately dash down-diagonally. (aka \u201cdbb\u201d for \u2018double block boost\u2019.)\n\n\u201cNeutral Drop\u201d \u00a0- Holding Down and letting go of Grab while holding an object will cause Madeline to drop whatever she is holding in place instead of flinging it in the direction she is facing.\n\n\u201cNeutral Jump\u201d \u00a0- Jumping from a wall while holding no direction  will not consume any stamina , and will push Madeline a very short distance from the wall. This is useful, as you can then press back towards the direction of the wall to perform another neutral jump. This allows you to scale walls without grabbing the wall or consuming stamina. (aka \u201cneutrals\u201d, \u201cneutral climb\u201d, or \u201cneutral wall jump\u201d.)\n\n\u201cNeutral Reverse Cornerboost\u201d \u00a0- A reverse cornerboost, but with a neutral climbjump (you release horizontal inputs before  climbjumping ) This means that you do not lose the 40 speed you usually do,  so usually are more efficient for speed if followed by another dash. However, since the climbjump is neutral, there is the possibility of wallbosting afterwards, which sets your speed to a constant. To avoid this, you should dash before holding downleft, and then change to holding downleft in freeze frames (to redirect the dash)  (aka \u201cnrcb\u201d)\n\n\"Overclocking\" \u00a0- This refers to any tech that results in Madeline receiving more stamina than her normal maximum using a wallboost. Most commonly this \u00a0is done by  performing a wallboost while in contact with the ground.  Because the player is starting from the ground, stamina is not consumed by the  action , however, the stamina refund is still applied, giving Madeline extra stamina. This is just one example; this tech can be performed by resetting Madeline\u2019s stamina in any way in the middle of a wallboost.  (see also \u201cwallboost\u201d.) (Not to be confused with \u201cgrounded wallbost\u201d)\n\n\u201cOverhangs\u201d  -  A \u00a0dashless tech which is performed when Madeline jumps from one wall and jumps onto the same wall but bulged by a few tiles. The easiest overhangs are 1-3 tile overhangs, which are very lenient and quite easy to pull off. However, 4tiles, 5tiles, and 6tiles require much more precise and difficult moves to pull off.. There are also a couple of niche overhangs, including 3x2 which is when Madeline has to jump 3 tiles horizontally and 2 tiles vertically, and a 2x1 which is 2 tiles horizontally and 1 tile vertically.\n\n\u201cPerfect Cornerjump\u201d  (aka \u201cpcj\u201d, sometimes referred to jokingly as \u201c penis cock jump \u201d) \u00a0 Missing Descriptor [ac] [ad] [ae] [af]\n\n\u201cPuffer Boost\u201d \u00a0- Similar to \u2018Bumper Boost\u2019, this technique involves holding the direction away from a pufferfish as it explodes to gain more speed and distance. Holding the direction towards the pufferfish has the opposite effect. (aka \u201cFish Boost\u201d, \u201cFoost\u201d)\n\n\"Reform Tech\" \u00a0-  Blocks that break and respawn (Move Blocks, Core Blocks etc.) respawn initially without their spikes and the spikes load in shortly after. This gives a brief window of time to land on the top of the block.\n\n\u201cRetention Tech\u201d \u00a0- Entering a booster in \u00a0a particular way (specific details needed) \u00a0puts Madeline in a strange state where the game thinks she\u2019s inside the bubble, while Madeline is still moving outside of the bubble. This allows the player to fire the bubble, immediately snapping Madeline back inside of the bubble.  [ag]\n\n\"Reverse Cornerboost\" \u00a0- \u00a0P erforming an up-diagonal dash \u00a0from underneath a bottom corner of a wall with high speed, and then turning around and  climbjumping \u00a0off of the wall cancels the dash and allows the dash momentum to be retained into the  climbjump .\n\n\u201cReverse Super\u201d, \u201cReverse Hyper\u201d or \u201cReverse Wavedash\u201d \u00a0- While performing a super, hyper, or wavedash, jumping in the opposite horizontal direction to the dash causes the resulting speed to be given in the opposite direction to normal. As with a regular super/hyper/wavedash, if Madeline is in contact with the floor on or after the 10th frame of the dash, she will retain her dash, which is called 'extending'. This technique is typically used to extend a super/hyper/wavedash off a small platform against a wall, where it would normally not be possible to. \u00a0Reverse is sometimes shortened to \u2018rev\u2019.\n\n\u201cRoboboost\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0An extremely complicated TAS-only speedrun technique.  Needs elaboration . [ah] [ai] [aj] [ak] [al]\n\n\u201cScreen Transition Cassette Offset\u201d  - Using a screen transition as a cassette block activates causes all cassette blocks of that color in the new screen to be one pixel higher, and all cassette blocks of the previous color to be one pixel lower .  This video  showcases an example of this phenomenon.\n\n\u201cSeeker Boost\u201d \u00a0- Similarly to a bumper boost or puffer boost, holding the direction away from a seeker at the moment it respawns will propel Madeline away from the seeker at a much higher speed and distance. Due to the difficulty in execution, this technique is seldom used. (See also, \u2018bumper boost\u2019)\n\n\u201cShoryuken\u201d -  [am]\n\n\"Slow Fall\" \u00a0-  While holding the jump button as Madeline is in a jump arc, Madeline\u2019s descent will be slightly slowed down until she reaches maximum falling velocity. Unlike Fast Falling, this technique is very difficult to discern from regular falling, as the difference is so small and there is no physical change in Madeline\u2019s sprite.  [Verify] [an] [ao]\n\n\u201cSnake Ultra\u201d  - This refers to an ultra that can be performed with superdash by having the player dash downright, shift down, then downright, then right, or vice versa. This gives the player high speed and results in an S-shaped dash pattern (aka \u201csnultra\u201d. Some people mistakenly believe that this tech is called a \u201csnail ultra\u201d.)\n\n\u201cSpike d \u00a0Climb\u201d \u00a0- I f Madeline maintains low speed away from a spiked wall, she can remain within a 2 pixel distance away from it, and therefore still able to jump off the wall (due to wall jump leniency) without the dying to the spikes since she has speed moving in the direction that they face. Spike climbs in which Madeline moves a significant distance up the wall are sometimes TAS-only. An example of a spike climb can be found  here , though not all spike climbs are as long as this.  (aka \u201cspike climb\u201d, \u201csplimb\u201d)\n\n\u201cSpike Clip\u201d \u00a0 If Madeline is moving downwards at a high enough  velocity [ap] \u00a0towards spikes with no tile beneath them, Madeline may move through the spike without dying. The way that she does this is by having the bottom pixel of her hurtbox go from above the spike hitbox to below it in 1 frame, essentially frame skipping the spike. The reason this happens is because the developers made it so that the bottom pixel is the only pixel that needs to be touching the spike in order for madeline to get killed.  (aka \u201cspikeclip\u201d, this tech is sometimes also called \u201cspikefall\u201d or \u201cspike fall\u201d, but this term can also refer to a setup to perform a spike clip.)\n\n\u201cSpike Clipped Dream Boost\u201d  - When there are spikes surrounding a dream block and Madeline does a perfect dash towards a corner, it\u2019s possible for Madeline to seemingly clip through the spikes and get the boost from the dream block despite there being no area for Madeline to touch the dream block. Due to its precision and limited application, it is rarely used in custom maps. This tech is most often referred to as a joke. (aka \u201cSplipped Droost\u201d.)\n\n\u201cSpike Jump\u201d \u00a0- When an external object, such as wind or zip movers, pushes Madeline into spikes or pushes spikes into Madeline while Madeline has speed away from the spikes, there is a brief window of time where she can jump off the wall behind the spikes due to the order in which Celeste handles operations. (Not to be confused with Corner Jumps, Corner Kicks or 5 /6 Jumps)\n\n\u201cSpiked Cornerboost\u201d  - A spiked cornerboost is a precise cornerboost on a spike-covered tile performed by positioning Madeline just above the spike hitbox, but low enough to perform a wall jump from the tile.\n\n\u201cSpiked Wallbounce\u201d \u00a0- \u00a0Madeline can perform a wallbounce off of a spiked tile if the jump is performed during the three frames of  leniency \u00a0after the 15 normal frames of dash (see also, \u2018dash attack\u2019) and if the player holds in the same direction that the spikes are facing.  [aq] [ar]\n\n\u201cSpinner Stun\u201d \u00a0- This is a difficult technique that exploits the system. By unpausing and pausing on consecutive frames, the player can prevent the spinners\u2019 hitboxes from loading, allowing Madeline to pass through them. By beginning the process of loading in a group of spinners (each screen has three spinner groups) while Madeline is near enough to them to load, and pausing constantly, allowing the game to only run unpaused for one or two frames at a time, the spinners will remain unloaded. (aka \u201cstun\u201d)\n\n\u201cSpinner Unload\u201d \u00a0- Spinner Unloads refer to a variety of tech that involve unloading the spinners on a screen in some way. There are many ways to do this. The most common way is to move so that the spinners are no longer on screen. If the player can somehow move offscreen, the spinners will be unloaded and Madeline can safely move through them. This can be achieved by having high enough speed that the spinners don\u2019t have enough time to load when they come onscreen or that Madeline herself is offscreen. This can also be achieved with a glitch that involves waiting  119 hours (need exact amount of time) \u00a0for two thirds of the spinners in a room to unload.  [as]\n\n\"Spring Cancel\" \u00a0- Dashing quickly after hitting a spring cancels the momentum from the spring. (aka \"sprancel\")\n\n\u201cSquish Refill\u201d  -  Missing Descriptor\n\n\u201cStamina\u201d \u00a0- Stamina is a  stat istic which depletes when Madeline either climbs up a wall, hangs  onto \u00a0a wall or performs a climbjump. Madeline\u2019s maximum stamina is 110 units. When she runs out of stamina, she will no longer be able to grab walls. Madeline\u2019s sprite will begin to flash red when she has below 20 units of stamina, at which point she will be able to continue holding a wall until she runs out of stamina but cannot grab another wall. She may still climbjump. Madeline will instantly regain stamina by touching the ground, interacting with an entity, collecting a refill, or entering a screen transition. Note that climbing down a wall does not deplete stamina.\n\n\u201cStamina Canceling\u201d \u00a0- When climbing a wall, holding up and tapping grab repeatedly instead of simply holding up and grab. When done correctly, this uses less stamina than climbing the wall normally.\n\n\u201cSubpixels\u201d \u00a0- Madeline's position, as well as some \u00a0other entities such as the Theo Crystal and Seekers, are saved as a Float (decimal) value. [au] \u00a0This means that despite their positions only being shown as occupying a certain set of pixels, their position is actually significantly more precise than that. This subpixel position can be manipulated by performing certain actions, such as dashing into a wall, landing on the ground, or  climbjumping \u00a0into a ceiling. Occasionally, when needing to fall into a pixel perfect gap for example, Madeline's subpixel position may sometimes prevent her from getting to the needed pixel by just holding in that direction, which is due to movement speed being a decimal number of pixels per frame.\n\n\u201cSuperdash\u201d  - A  mechanic  that appears in the  \u2018variants\u2019 \u00a0menu wherein Madeline is given a longer dash which can be course-corrected. Some custom maps can have this mechanic set by default for a unique challenge. (Not to be confused with \u2018Super Dash\u2019.)\n\n\u201cSuper Dash\u201d \u00a0(usually just \u201csuper\u201d) - Following a horizontal Dash on the ground with a Jump will allow Madeline to perform a longer and faster jump with the same height as a normal jump. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to performing a dash. (Not to be confused with \u2018Superdash\u2019.)\n\n\u201cSuperwave\u201d \u00a0- An extended super dash quickly followed by a reverse wavedash. Usually performed on crumble platforms and pink clouds.\n\n\u201cTheo Stall\u201d  -\n\n\u201cThrowable Dream Hyper\u201d \u00a0- A dream hyper done while holding a throwable. To perform this tech, you must perform a dream grab and then a dream hyper in quick succession after leaving a dream block. If you do not dream grab, the throwable is dropped/thrown upon leaving the dream block. (aka \u201ctheo dryper\u201d, \u201ctheo dream hyper\u201d)\n\n\u201cUltra\u201d \u00a0- Colliding with the ground from a down diagonal dash will give Madeline a 1.2x speed boost, and, if this collision happens after the dash ends, allow preservation of that speed. A jump is often used after this to preserve speed and gain more distance. For further detail, see the  Ultras and You \u00a0doc. This is sometimes called an \"Ultra Dash\", but that term is inaccurate, as there are several parts to an ultra apart from the dash. (aka \u201cUltras\u201d.)\n\n(That said, because of how ultras are introduced and nuance with getting the 1.2x speed multiplier may lead to people having inconsistent definitions of ultras and related terms.)\n\n\u201cUndemo\u201d  - a niche tech allowing the first frame of a down or down diagonal dash to be done without crouch. It is performed by starting a regular dash that is not down or down diagonal and then redirecting to down or down diagonal (the inverse of a manual demo).\n\n\u201c Wallboost\u201d \u00a0 - Doing a neutral  climbjump \u00a0then holding away from the wall within 11 frames will refund the stamina consumed by the move and instantly sets speed to 130 in the direction opposite of the wall. (aka \u201cwoost\u201d) (not to be confused with \u201cwallbounce.\u201d)\n\n\u201cWallbounce\u201d \u00a0- Dashing up and pressing Jump near a wall allows you to jump very high off of the wall. This technique is introduced in chapter 7B in vanilla Celeste. (aka \"wounce\" or \u201cwbounce\u201d, not to be confused with \u201cwallboost\u201d.)\n\n\u201cWall Jump\u201d \u00a0- If Madeline is right next to a wall, she can do a wall jump away from the wall, or in the neutral direction. Doing this in the neutral direction is called a \u2018neutral jump\u2019.  If Madeline jumps in the direction towards the wall while holding the wall, she will consume some stamina and jump in the direction towards the wall , which is called a \u2018 climbjump \u2019. If she is not holding the wall but attempts any wall jump other than a neutral jump, she will jump away from the wall instead. This is often the result of running out of stamina. (see also, \u2018neutral jump\u2019 and \u2018climb jump\u2019.)\n\n\u201cWater Boost\u201d -  When near the top  of a pool of water, Madeline can jump and if moving in a direction her jump grants the normal +40 speed boost. This can be performed every frame until Madeline is out of the water allowing the ability to get 200+ speed then any prior speed entering the water.  Although this technique is not TAS-only, TAS bots can perform this technique more  proficiently \u00a0than human players.\n\n\u201cWavedash\u201d \u00a0- Starting in midair, dashing towards the ground and jumping just before hitting the ground will give Madeline her dash back and propel her forward, similarly to an extended hyper. This technique can also be performed using a booster, as it is similar to a dash. This technique is introduced and used extensively in Farewell.\n\n\u201cWrap Hyper\u201d \u00a0- This refers to when the player performs a dream hyper out of a dream block that they entered while crouched by performing a dream grab \u00a0to uncrouch \u00a0then inputting a hyper during coyote frames. It is very similar to performing a standard dream grab hyper, without theo, and done to uncrouch. It does not work diagonally. It is called this because Bred was eating a wrap when she decided to name it. Yup.\n\n\u201cYump\u201d \u00a0-  Missing Descriptor\n\nCustom Maps [av]\n\nCustom maps are maps created by the Celeste community to be played and enjoyed. Below is a list of some of the most historically important and highly regarded custom Celeste maps that exist, but it must be noted that this list is incomplete due to the sheer increasing number of existing custom Celeste maps.  We can add a resource to find more Celeste maps here too; I\u2019m thinking gamebanana or one of the more reputable map lists that exists.\n\n\u201cStrawberry Jam Collab\u201d \u00a0 - a large mod released in 2023, currently the largest Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSJ2023\u201d, \u201cSJ2021\u201d, \u201cStrawberry Jam\u201d, or \"SJ\".)  Below is a list of maps from Strawberry Jam, arranged in roughly ascending difficulty:\n\nSJ Beginner Lobby\n\n\u201cForest Path\u201d  - a green beginner map which takes place in a dark forest. The map utilizes dream refills, which allow you to dash through normal blocks as if they were a dream block. This is the easiest map in strawberry jam, and is a likely first map in strawberry jam.\n\n\u201cAzure Caverns\u201d  - a green beginner map taking place in a lush cave filled with boiling hot water. This map utilizes traffic blocks that only activate upon dashing into it, similar to a Kevin block.\n\n\u201cLoopy Lagoon\u201d  - a green beginner map which takes place in an ocean of milk.  The map is built around the mechanic of the giant cereal flakes, which resemble square Froot Loops. These cereal flakes have unique properties which bounce Madeline depending on how she interacts with them.\n\n\u201cCollapsing Skyline\u201d  - a green beginner map which takes place in a collapsing and ruined city filled with skyscrapers. This map utilizes dash blocks from mirror temple and falling blocks  to create a simple but uneasy platforming challenge.\n\n\u201cSeeing is Believing\u201d  - a green beginner map which is famous for its unique gameplay. This map features extremely easy gameplay, however you must do it without seeing. The intended way to play is to play blindfolded as a friend guides you through the map. However, most people do not have friends, so this map includes an alternative route where the room is completely darkened, with  Badeline \u00a0guiding the player through instead.\n\n\u201cIf my \u2018driveway\u2019 almost did you in\u2026\u201d  - a yellow beginner map which takes place in the same area as the prologue in vanilla celeste. The map is a reference to the prologue, where Madeline walks under a falling block. When she tells granny this, she laughs at Madeline and says, \u201cif my \u2018driveway\u2019 almost did you in, the Mountain might be a bit much for you,\u201d hence the name of the map. This entity, used only for this interaction in the vanilla game, is explored more thoroughly by this map. (aka \u201cdriveway\u201d)\n\n\u201cCassette Cliffs\u201d  - a yellow beginner map that takes place at the top of a giant rainforest. This map uses cassette blocks, cassette traffic blocks, and other types of cassette blocks there are, hence why it\u2019s called \u201ccassette cliffs\u201d. (aka \u201cccliffs\u201d)\n\n\u201cOver the City\u201d  - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a city at night. This somewhat lengthy and winding map disables Madeline\u2019s dash so it may focus solely on the jump crystal mechanic. (aka \u201cotc\u201d)\n\n\u201cTroposphere\u201d  - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a dream set above the mountain. This map is a somewhat simple platforming puzzle focusing on  Badeline \u00a0boosts and dream blocks.\n\n\u201cPotential for Anything\u201d \u00a0A yellow beginner map which utilizes gravity inversion mechanics. This map is a reference to the video game VVVVVV.\n\n\u201cMidnight  Spire\u201d \u00a0 - A yellow beginner map that takes place in a blue tower. The background implies that the map also takes place in a mountainous region with a giant lake in the center. This map\u2019s platforming is somewhat tight and restrictive, but fairly easy.\n\n\u201cpaint\u201d  - a yellow beginner map that takes place in a colorful and lively village. This map places emphasis on its story, as Madeline struggles with a work of art that she believes is not good enough and struggles to make it perfect; meanwhile,  Badeline \u00a0attempts to act as a voice of reason and urges her to take better care of herself. The map\u2019s platforming relies on more traditional game mechanics of moving platforms and dodging projectiles, set in time with the map\u2019s music. Due to the map\u2019s high-effort presentation, it is widely regarded to be the most iconic map in all of Strawberry Jam.\n\n\u201cRose Garden\u201d  - A yellow beginner map which takes heavy inspiration from Super Mario Galaxy, particularly the gusty garden galaxy. The map\u2019s main mechanic, a holdable rose which acts as a parachute, giving Madeline an upwards boost whenever she presses the dash button, is also an idea borrowed from Super Mario Galaxy.\n\n\u201cTreehive\u201d  - A yellow beginner map themed around a large beehive inside of a tree. The map\u2019s main mechanic is a particular variant of dream blocks, sometimes refered to as \u201choney blocks\u201d, which allow Madeline to reflect off of walls while inside, instead of dying when colliding with a wall.\n\n\u201cThe Squeeze\u201d  - a yellow beginner map taking place in a dismal city. The map challenges the player to use the level geometry to line  Madeline \u00a0up to fall into several  tight \u00a0gaps.\n\n\u201cSoap\u201d  - A red beginner map that takes place in a blue, bubbly environment. The main mechanics of this map are blue variants of entities found in the vanilla game, such as bubbles and springs, which, in their blue form, do not replenish Madeline\u2019s dash. This encourages the player to think twice about when and where to use their limited dashes.\n\n\u201cSwitchtube Vista\u201d  - A red beginner map that takes place in a purple, retro city. Its main mechanics are pipes which function similarly to warp pipes from the Super Mario franchise, and switch blocks which toggle certain portions of the level between being on and off. The map is highly evocative of retro games from the NES era, as its mechanics, presentation, and music all appear to draw inspiration from retro Nintendo games.\n\n\u201cA Gift From the Stars\u201d  - a red beginner puzzle map taking place in a forest at a UFO crash site. This map explores time-stopping mechanics to create infamously challenging puzzles. (aka \u201cagfts\u201d)\n\n\u201cStrawberry Orchard\u201d  - A red beginner map that takes place on a ranch, as Madeline cartoonishly endeavors to steal a jar of the ranch\u2019s famous strawberry jam. This map primarily utilizes pipes, as well as a heavy throwable jar of jam that the player must navigate to the end of each screen. This map is considered to have the most challenging platforming of the beginner lobby. (aka \u201corchard\u201d)\n\n\u201c Dropzle \u201d  - a red beginner puzzle map in which the player must use their finite number of dashes to align a series of Kevins in such a way that allows her to drop through a pixel perfect gap, hence \u2018 dropzle \u2019. Although it is possible, albeit challenging for most, to jump straight through the gap, it is discouraged by the map creator to do so. (Sometimes the term \u201cdropzle\u201d is also used to refer to pixel perfect gaps, in reference to this map.)\n\n\u201cCoresaken City\u201d  - a red beginner map combining decoration and mechanics of Chapter 1, Forsaken City, and Chapter 8, Core.\n\n\u201cBlueberry Bay\u201d  - the final challenge of the beginner lobby, Blueberry Bay is a beach-themed heartside with one flag dedicated to each of the maps in the beginner lobby.\n\nSJ Intermediate Lobby\n\n\u201cSleeping Under Stars\u201d -  a green intermediate map similar to Farewell in design but utilizes low gravity throughout the map.\n\n\u201cFrosted Fragments\u201d -  a green intermediate map that takes place in a frigid cave. It\u2019s main mechanics are blocks that the player can push to get further through the level or to obtain double dash refills and green boosters.\n\n\u201cFifth Dimension\u201d -  a green intermediate map that is defaulted to two dashes, makes use of boosters that don\u2019t refill the player\u2019s dash, and uses wallbounces as its primary technique.\n\n\u201cLow-G Botany\u201d -  missing description\n\n\u201cSpring Collab 2020\u201d \u00a0 - a large mod released in 2020. Prior to Strawberry Jam Collab, this was the largest and most well known Celeste mod. (aka \u201cSC2020\u201d, \u201cSpring Collab\u201d, or \u201cSC\u201d.)\n\nKeep in mind that standards for difficulty have increased since the map\u2019s release. A map from Spring Collab listed under Grandmaster difficulty may nowadays be considered merely Expert difficulty, for instance. \u00a0Below is a list of maps from Spring Collab, arranged in roughly ascending difficulty:\n\nSC2020  Beginner Lobby\n\n\u201cSeeker Temple\u201d  - A green beginner map briefly exploring mechanics from chapter 5, Mirror Temple, including seekers. Map by  Cat_in_Box_01 .\n\n\u201cThoughtful Dreams\u201d  - A green beginner map exploring the unique dash mechanics of Chapter 8, Core. Map by  IsaGoodFriend .\n\n\u201c Starjump \u201d \u00a0- A green beginner map with simple, vertical platforming. Map by  Lichtbaulb .\n\n\u201cHeavenly  Altitudes\u201d \u00a0 - A yellow beginner map, primarily based on getting through a spinner obstacle course with  Badeline \u00a0orbs. Map by  Abby .\n\n\u201cAzurite Ascent\u201d  - A yellow beginner map utilizing various mechanics. It is well known for its atmospheric presentation. Map by  CANADIAN .\n\n\u201cSpace Jam Fever Dream\u201d  - A yellow beginner map centered around the modded mechanic of dashing while inside a dream block to change direction. It is known for its easter egg referencing YouTuber CarlSagan42. Made by  cruor . (aka \u201cSJFD\u201d)\n\n\u201cBlast Processing\u201d  - A yellow beginner puzzle map centered around the mechanics of light beams used to activate doors, as well as color-coded zip blocks. Map by  Flagpole1up .\n\n\u201cThe Singularity\u201d  - A yellow beginner map that uses small dream blocks. Map by  Ghajestis .\n\n\u201c Badeline \u00a0Block Belt\u201d \u00a0- A yellow beginner map exploring moving block cycles from chapter 6. Map by  hennyburgr .\n\n\u201cTemple of the Kevins\u201d  - A yellow beginner map centered around Kevins. (see also, Kevins.) The map is well known for its presentation, with the tiles being composed entirely of Kevins, and music made with the soundfont of Kevin\u2019s voice. It is also known for its connection to the grandmaster map, Crypt of the Kevins, also from the Spring Collab. (aka \u201cTotK\u201d, not to be confused with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.) Map by  iamdadbod .\n\n\u201cMossy Caverns\u201d  - A yellow beginner map which mostly takes place underwater, with an added oxygen mechanic. Map by  itsabrody . (aka \" Maverns \")\n\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s Outer Space\u201d  - A yellow beginner dashless dark map by  Rue .\n\n\u201cInto the Storm\u201d  - A simple yellow beginner level utilizing red bubbles and conveyor belts. Map by  Snas .\n\n\u201cChillout Mountain\u201d  - A yellow beginner dashless map using the snowball mechanic from Chapter 4, Golden Ridge, set to LoFi music. Map by  Thegur90.\n\n\u201cDesolate Spire\u201d  - A red beginner map introducing the modded mechanic of midair jump crystals. Map by  Bissy .\n\n\u201cCrystal Enigma\u201d  - A red beginner puzzle map utilizing unique door button mechanics and Theo\u2019s crystal. Map by  Cookie .\n\n\u201cElectric Stratosphere\u201d  - A short red beginner map exploring mechanics from Chapter 9, including jellyfish, electric fields, and the bird. Map by  DanTKO .\n\n\u201cCirque  Maderano \u201d \u00a0 - A red beginner map exploring the mechanics of moving platforms with springs and spikes, taking place in a circus tent. (aka \u201cCM\u201d, not to be confused with Cycle Madness, another Spring Collab map using the same abbreviation.) Map by  Skeleton .\n\n\u201cBeginner Heart Side\u201d  - The final challenge of the Spring Collab 2020 beginner lobby, with a section of each room dedicated to each of the maps from the lobby. Map made primarily by  Bissy . (aka \"BHS\", \u201cscbhs\u201d.)\n\nSC2020 Intermediate Lobby\n\n\u201cJots and Scribbles\u201d  - A green intermediate map centered around springs, with graphics that appear to be composed of pencil scribbles. Map by  Chloe . \u00a0 (aka \"Jibbles\")\n\n\u201cOvergrown City\u201d  - A green intermediate map themed around Forsaken City, with plant growth overtaking structures. This map primarily uses zip blocks to time the player through each section. Map by  Lichtbaulb .\n\n\u201cSerene Skydive\u201d  - A unique green intermediate map taking place as a freefall through an obstacle of spinners. It uses several extended variants, such as infinite dashes and a dash length reduction to let the player play at their own pace. Map by  Thegur90 .\n\n\u201cAbandoned and Ruined\u201d  \u00a0- A yellow intermediate map themed around a more ruined version of Chapter 3, Celestial Resort. Map by  aleph_null.\n\n\u201cElectrified Resort\u201d  - A yellow intermediate map themed around Chapter 3, Celestial Resort, with electricity fields and jellyfish. Map by  Bionicle .\n\n\u201cCity of Tears\u201d \u00a0- A yellow intermediate Forsaken City themed map with a focus on simple, tight platforming and intermediate tech. Map by  Donker19 .\n\n\u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d  - A yellow intermediate map centered around mechanics from Chapter 9, Farewell. Map by  EvilLeafy .\n\n\u201cHot and Cold Cavern\u201d \u00a0- A yellow intermediate core-themed level by  GG19 .

Map by  CANADIAN .\n\nAt the end of the final strawberry room in Heart of the Storm is a section labeled \u201ca nice view\u201d, aka \u201canv\u201d. This is regarded to be the hardest individual segment in the entirety of Spring Collab 2020 outside of the grandmaster heart side, and there is no reward for completing it except a pleasant view of some clouds. (Sometimes, a highly difficult secret room placed at the end of a map with no rewards is referred to as a \u2018nice view\u2019 or \u2018anv\u2019 in reference to this map.)\n\n\"Grandmaster Heart Side (New)\u201d \u00a0- (aka \u201cngmhs\u201d) The final challenge of the Spring Collab 2020 grandmaster lobby, and of spring collab as a whole.

The community usually refers to this portion as the \u201ctornado\u201d due to Madeline\u2019s rapid cyclic movement and the cloudy theme of this flag.

These maps are based on the Vanilla chapters 1 - 9. They are often abbreviated as [Chapter Number]D (e.g. \"2D\" for Old Site D-Side), but are sometimes also abbreviated with an \"M\" in front to denote \"Monika's\" due to other mappers making their own D-Side packs (e.g. \"M5D\" for Mirror Temple D-Side). Final Goodbye, sometimes referred to as 9D, has Golden Strawberries that are collected by doing several consecutive checkpoints deathless, and a Platinum Strawberry for completing the whole map deathless.\n\n\u201cFore\u201d  - a map by Scraggly1 combining Farewell and Core.

These maps consist of several extremely short, input-dense rooms which necessitate the use of retention tech to complete. The B-side is listed as a 2* on hardlist; the A-side and B-side used to both be required, but it was updated to only require the B-side since the A-side does not meet the standard of a 1*.

Its name is a misnomer, as it is in fact not a \u2018garbage version\u2019 of Chapter 5B from the base game; instead, it is a \u2018garbage version\u2019 of Chapter 7D, Summit, a custom map also made by Monika (see also, \u2018Monika\u2019s D sides\u2019).

This map intends precise  \u201chalf stamina climbs\u201d which used to be considered \u2018TAS only\u2019  before multiple people discovered they can be made easier using keybinds (though also viable without) . Ironically, the map is technically possible without the use of any half stamina climbs at all.\n\n\"Vivid Abyss\" \u00a0- A high grandmaster map made by ABuffZucchini.

The initial version of the map was one of the most notoriously difficult maps for its time. Later on, fishtank created a version that was nerfed in difficulty, removing many of the buffs and turning it from a GM+1 map to an Expert map harder than 7D. To distinguish between the old version and new version, they are sometimes abbreviated as \u201co7d1d\u201d and \u201cn7d1d\u201d, respectively.\n\n\"118.71% FulFilled Emptiness\"  A gm+1 dashless map utilizing extremely precise tech and with unsettling, minimal monochrome visuals.

These maps are both designed as extremely tight corridors lined with hazards that require the player to use precise tech to traverse. CPVL is designed horizontally, with the player moving rightwards, while LXVI is designed vertically, with the player moving upwards. The naming convention for these maps follows a pattern of two letters in a word being replaced with another random letter. \u2018moce\u2019 is nice, \u2018cpvl\u2019 is cave, and \u2018lxvi\u2019 is love. CPVL used to be called \u201cCPCL\u201d, which stood for  cock , spelling out nice// cock . This change was made due to issyy wanting //MOCE// to be a serious campaign, and the joke name CPCL did not suit this tone.\n\n\"Shatter Site\" \u00a0- a dashless map made by  AstralightSky . This map is infamous for its gameplay, being unplaytested and requiring numerous precise techniques to complete. The map\u2019s setting is a variant on Chapter 2, Old Site.

This was formally the \u00a0 \u00a0easiest 3* map on hardlist, used as the standard to determine if a map belongs in the 2* or 3* category. Clears for hardlist are accepted for any version after v1.4 and before v1.6. (aka \"cg\")\n\nThe second room of Crystal Garden (aka \u201ccg2\u201d) is by far the hardest in the map, being incredibly long and extremely complicated to route. The route used by Parrot Dash in his first clear was actually not the intended route, and has since been patched. It is rumored that nobody, not even the map\u2019s creator, knows the intended route to clear room 2.\n\n\"Madeline Votes in the  2020 \u00a0US Presidential Election D-Side\" \u00a0- A dashless map made by Jan. This is the final map in the \u201cMadeline votes in the 2020 US Presidential Election\u201d map pack, but is separate from the rest of the maps. This map is considered a joke, as the map is filled with crude dialogue and memes. This map is a lot harder than any other map in the pack, and is a 3* map on hardlist. \u00a0(aka \"delection\" or \u201celection d\u201d )\n\n\u201cD1D7\u201d \u00a0 - An extremely difficult  etselec \u00a0map of \u20187D1D\u2019 by fishtank_underflow. This map is a 3* on Hardlist, formerly the most difficult map cleared. One notable room in this map is:\n\n\u201c2k-3\u201d \u00a0- A nickname for the 3rd room of the 2000m checkpoint in the original 7D1D. In D1D7, it is an insanely difficult dropper room with multiple, incredibly tight gaps, some being pixel-perfect, requiring near TAS-level movement down to the subpixels (see also, \u201cSubpixel\u201d and \u201cTool-assisted speedrunning\u201d). Formerly the most difficult room cleared in Celeste.\n\n\u201cDashless+\u201d \u00a0- A buffed version of Chapter 1A, Forsaken City, which continues after the Forsaken City section into an original creation. It is a 3* map on Hardlist, (see also, \u2018hardlist\u2019,) and  is currently  considered the hardest custom map to ever be cleared. (aka \u201cD+\u201d). A particularly difficult room at the end is split into four segments, referred to by the community as \u201cQuarter 1\u201d, \u201cQuarter 2\u201d, \u201cQuarter 3\u201d, and \u201cQuarter 4\u201d, respectively. (aka \u201cQ1\u201d, \u201cQ2\u201d, \u201cQ3\u201d, and \u201cQ4\u201d.) This is widely regarded in the community as the hardest room ever cleared. (aka \u201cD+ final\u201d, \u201cD+24\u201d , or \u201c24\u201d)\n\n\u201cSuperfecta\u201d - \u00a0 Missing descriptor\n\n\u201c Flusheline \u00a0Community Collab\u201d \u00a0 Missing Descriptor  - (aka FLCC)\n\nSpeedrunning Terminology\n\nSpeedrunning is a style of playing a game with the goal of completing the game in as little time as possible, often competing against others for the best time. Below is a list of terms used in the Celeste community which are frequently, but not exclusively, used in the context of speedrunning the game, or other  adjacent practices, such as deathless runs.\n\n\u201cDeathless\u201d \u00a0- This refers to any challenge run or speedrun which requires no deaths throughout the entire playthrough.\n\n\u201cFull Clear\u201d  - These runs entail playing through an entire chapter or custom map, or sometimes an entire collab or lobby, while collecting every strawberry, and the cassette and crystal heart if applicable. (aka \u201cFC\u201d)\n\n\u201cLow Death\u201d -  A way of stating the lowest number of deaths you have gotten in a run of a particular map/checkpoint , generally used when practicing. For example, \u201cFW low death 12\u201d means that you have done a complete clear of Farewell in twelve deaths. \u201cRM low death 3\u201d would mean that you\u2019ve done the Remembered checkpoint from Farewell in three deaths.\n\n\u201cPersonal Best\u201d  - A personal record for lowest deaths, lowest time, or most progress on a screen or map without dying is called a \u201cpersonal best\u201d or \u201cPB\u201d for short.\n\n\u201cSpeedrun Category\u201d \u00a0- Speedruns of nearly every game, including Celeste, have multiple categories, which have different requirements for a speedrun to be valid. Below is a list of Celeste\u2019s main speedrun categories, taken from  speedrun.com :  [ba]\n\n\u201c100%\u201d - Complete all chapters, collect all 175 red berries, and collect the moon berry from a new file. (Most games have a 100% category for speedrunning.) \u201cAll Cassettes\u201d - Collect all 8 Cassette Tapes and complete Chapter 8A from a new file. \u201cAll Hearts\u201d - Collect all 24 hearts from a new file. \u201cAll Red Berries\u201d (aka \u201cARB\u201d) - Collect all 175 red berries and complete Chapter 8A from a new file. (\u2018ARB\u2019 is also a general term used to mean simply collecting all red berries.) \u201cAny%\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file. (Most games have an Any% category for speedrunning. It simply requires the player to beat the main game.) \u201cBny%\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file without completing any A-Sides. \u201cTrue Ending\u201d - Complete Farewell from a new file.\n\nSome less common speedrun categories include:\n\n\u201c1-UP in Four Chapters\u201d - Obtain a 1-Up in four separate chapters. Use of Cheat Mode is allowed. \u201c202 Berries\u201d - Collect all 202 strawberries, all 24 hearts, all 8 tapes, and complete all chapters from a new file. (aka \u201cMax%\u201d, \u201cTrue Max%\u201d) \u201c25 Golden Berries\u201d - Collect 25 golden berries from a new file. You are not required to play the chapter Farewell. Use of cheat mode is allowed. \u201cAll Cassettes Cheat Mode\u201d - Collect all 8 Cassette Tapes from a new file. 8a does not need to be completed. Use of Cheat Mode is allowed. \u201cAssist Mode\u201d - Complete the subcategory objective with any assist mode options allowed other than skipping levels. \u201cBerry Sampler\u201d - From a new file, collect 1 red berry from each checkpoint that contains any berries. Use of cheat mode is allowed. \u201cCity IL x10\u201d - From a new file, enter the cheat code in Prologue and complete chapter 1A ten times consecutively. \u201cEpilogue Pies\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file and collect a certain number of strawberries corresponding to an ending pie. Use of cheat mode is not allowed. \u201cInvisible Any%\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file with the invisible variant enabled. \u201cMirror Mode\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file with the mirror mode variant enabled. \u201cNG+\u201d - From a new file, collect 1 red berry from each checkpoint that contains any berries. Use of cheat mode is allowed.  \u201cNo Grabbing\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file with the no grabbing variant enabled. \u201cSuper Dash\u201d - Unlock the Epilogue from a new file with the super dashing variant enabled.  (This refers to the \u2018superdash\u2019 variant, not the \u2018super dash\u2019 technique!) \u201cTrue 100% Deathless\u201d (aka \u201cmax% 202 berries Deathless\u201d or \u201cThe Perfect Celeste Run\u201d) - In one sitting, collect all 202 strawberries, all 24 hearts, and all 8 cassette tapes, and complete all chapters from a new save file, as well as obtaining every achievement completing the PICO-8 Celeste classic minigame and collecting all 18 strawberries from there, with only one mandatory death during the moonberry segment. This category has only ever been completed by runner \u2018Rickfernello\u2019.  His video completing this challenge can be seen here. \u00a0This category is not documented on speedrun.com.  \u201cPre DLC\u201d - Complete all chapters available in patches before 1.3.0.0 from a new file. (This category serves mainly as an archive for Any% runs that occurred prior to the release of the Farewell DLC on December 9th, 2019.) \u201cPrologue\u201d - Complete Prologue from a new file.\n\n\u201cSave States\u201d -  Save states (aka \u2018states\u2019) are a functionality which allows the player to reload a Celeste screen to a certain chosen point. They are commonly used in other games, especially modded games and emulators. They are especially used by modded Celeste players to practice hard screens, at a certain difficulty when it becomes harder to make progress without the use of save states. A \u201cdead state\u201d refers to when a player sets a save state at a point which is guaranteed to kill them, or that makes progress impossible. \u201cStateless\u201d is used to refer to when a player clears something without using save states.\n\n\u201cTool-assisted Speedrunning\u201d \u00a0- A category of speedrunning where inputs are written by one or more people to be read back and performed in real time by a bot. This is also used outside of the Celeste community. Maps or challenges that are too difficult or impossible to be performed by a human, but can be performed by a bot, are referred to as \u201cTAS only\u201d. (aka \u201cTAS\u201d.)\n\nCommunity Resources\n\nBelow is a list of Celeste\u2019s most frequented community resources.\n\n\u201cAhorn\u201d  - A map making software for Celeste currently not being worked on. Its replacement, L\u00f6nn, is currently being worked on and actively improved. Because L\u00f6nn is not yet finished, some mappers may still prefer Ahorn. Ahorn is built into Olympus as a one button launch.\n\n\u201cCeleste\u2019s Hardest Maps Clear List\u201d \u00a0- A collection of the most difficult (non TAS-only) custom Celeste maps that have been cleared by a human. \u00a0 Celeste's Hardest Maps Clear List can be found here. \u00a0Maps on the hardlist are classified in terms of  one star, two stars, and three stars, abbreviated as \u201c1*\u201d, \u201c2*\u201d, and \u201c3*\u201d, respectively [bb] . The more stars, the harder the map. \u00a0( aka \"hardlist\", \u00a0\u201chist\u201d, \u201chlist\u201d, or \u201ch-list\u201d .)\n\n\u201cCeleste Discord\u201d \u00a0- Celeste\u2019s official Discord server! This is the central hub of the Celeste community. They can be joined at  https://discord.gg/celeste . (aka \" celestecord \" or \" clord \")\n\n\u201c Celestenet \u201d  - An extremely popular Celeste mod that allows for some multiplayer connectivity, such as seeing other players in real time, grabbing them, or jumping off of their heads. The game world, such as the position of Theo or whether a falling block has fallen, is localized to each individual player. Account setup and download is available at  https://celestenet.0x0a.de/ .\n\n\"Custom Map Golden Strawberry List\" \u00a0- A collection of deathless runs achieved for various modded maps. The  Custom Map Golden Strawberry List \u00a0can be found here.  Completed goldens and silvers of individual maps are placed into the Standard Golden List, which are a comparable difficulty to most vanilla goldens, or the Hard Golden List, which are above the difficulty of the Hell Trio.\n\nThe Hard Golden List is also ranked in the Top Golden List, where the bottom, Tier 7, is for goldens/silvers just harder than the Hell Trio. Difficulty rises as the tier number descends, where Tier 0 is currently the hardest achieved golden. Farewell Golden serves as the bottom of Tier 3, and tiers 0-3 are also ranked by subcategories designated by the cell fill saturation. Maps easier than tier 3 are listed in tiers/subcategories in alphabetical order. Tiers are often abbreviated by \"T#\", where a Tier 4 golden would be referred to as a T4. (aka \"molden list\")\n\n\u201cEverest\u201d  - The mod loader for Celeste, available on  github \u00a0or  gamebanana . Everest is built into Olympus as a one button launch.\n\n\u201cGamebanana\u201d -  A website \u00a0for hosting a variety of games and mods. Gamebanana is the standard platform for hosting Celeste mods, although some are simply uploaded to Google Drive.\n\n\u201cL\u00f6nn\u201d  - The map making software for Celeste, currently being worked on by several talented programmers. It is unfinished as of now, so mappers may still prefer Ahorn. L\u00f6nn is built into Olympus as a one button launch, though this is only accessible through the settings menu first. (aka \"Loenn\".)\n\n\"Olympus\" \u00a0- A convenient GUI made for quick access to unmodified Celeste, Everest, Ahorn, L\u00f6nn, downloaded mods, Gamebanana, and more, available on  github \u00a0or  gamebanana ..\n\nCommunity References\n\nBelow is a list of references and inside jokes frequently used by the Celeste community.\n\n\u201c1170\u201d  - An infamous death that circled around the celeste community for a while. This death features celeste player \u201cShye\u201d playing 2k3 [requires its own section, possibly under D1D7] in celeste map \u2018D1D7\u2019 (see also, \u2018D1D7\u2019) before passing the hardest gap at the end and not pushing any buttons to move into the final gap. This death is a meme due to the immense discord posts showcasing the death as a reaction.\n\n\u201cBonk\u201d  - community term for when Madeline hits her head on an object, usually after a wall bounce. is used frequently outside of the Celeste community as well.\n\n\u201cBurgy\u201d \u00a0- A cross between Kirby and a burger, which is a common emote in the Celeste Community, and often seen as a mascot. ( if anyone knows the origins feel free to add that [bc] )\n\n\u201cCarwash\u201d \u00a0- Sometimes used to refer to wavedashes or failed wavedashes, this term comes from the  mod  Celeste, Google Translated Edition \u00a0where, during the wavedash tutorial presentation, the text \u201cWith Wavedashing, you can jump very far and regain your dash  at the same time! \u201d is replaced with \u201c Carwash \u00a0allows you to go through windows simultaneously.\u201d\n\n\u201cComf\u201d \u00a0- short for \u2018comfy,\u2019 this is a community term for when Madeline crouches in a one-block high gap.\n\n\u201cFrogeline\u201d \u00a0- One of the many emotes used in the Celeste Discord server, this  emote \u00a0is often used to celebrate or congratulate other users\u2019 accomplishments. It depicts Madeline as a frog with a gaping mouth.\n\n\u201cHell Trio\u201d  - A community term for three golden strawberries in celeste, 6bg, 7bg, and 8bg, which were each considered collectively as the hardest challenges in the game prior to the release of the Chapter 9 update, when the Farewell golden strawberry became Celeste\u2019s pen ultimate \u00a0challenge. These serve as the baseline for custom modded map goldens/silvers to be on the Hard Golden List.\n\nDisorganized and Miscellaneous Entries\n\nAny entries that have not yet been sorted or cannot be sorted into a specific category will go here.\n\n\u201c0 framed\u201d \u00a0- (aka \u201c0f\u201d) A phenomenon which can happen due to the way Celeste calculates the position of a moving entity at any given moment. All movement in the game is tied to frames, and Celeste has a default frame rate of 60 frames per second. From one frame to another, the player\u2019s position, for example, is calculated to have been moved by a certain number of pixels, and they are never considered to be present in between those positions. This makes it possible to clip through hazards without interacting with them at high enough speeds, as there are zero frames where the hazard can interact with Madeline. An example of this phenomenon is hitting a spiked Kevin using a green booster. This also makes certain actions impossible at high speeds, since there are no frames where the player is in the correct position to perform said action.\n\n\u201cCollab\u201d \u00a0- Collabs are packs of maps made by several map creators.  (Collabs are all independent projects. Other similarly named collabs are not necessarily affiliated with one another. For example, Winter Collab 2021 is not affiliated with Spring Collab 2020.)\n\n\u201c Strawberry Jam Collab\u201d \u00a0- A large mod released in 2023. (aka \u201cStrawberry Jam\u201d, \u201cSJ2023\u201d, or \"SJ\".)  (Anything specifically associated with Strawberry Jam Collab will be given red text.)\n\n(See Custom Maps section below for more information!)\n\n\u201c Spring Collab 2020\u201d \u00a0- A large mod released in 2020. Prior to Strawberry Jam Collab, this was the largest and most well known Celeste mod.  (aka \u201cSC2020\u201d, \u201cSpring Collab\u201d, or \u201cSC\u201d.)  (Anything specifically associated with Spring Collab 2020 will be given green text.) (See Custom Maps section below for more information!)\n\n\u201cSilver Strawberry\u201d \u00a0- These are essentially the same as a golden strawberry, as they are obtained from completing the map without dying. They are often used in maps in collabs, as they represent that maps in collabs are often shorter than an average map. Similarly to goldens, silver strawberries are abbreviated with an \"S\" at the end, for example, Treehive Silver would be \"TreehiveS\". \u00a0(aka \u201csilver\u201d)\n\n\u201cRainbow Strawberry\u201d \u00a0 - Spoilers for Spring Collab, Strawberry Jam, and other collabs and contests.  These are obtained in certain collabs and/or contests, including Spring Collab and Strawberry Jam Collab, as a reward for collecting every silver strawberry in a lobby.\n\n\"Speed Berry\" \u00a0- Appearing as a yellow strawberry with a clock, this strawberry serves as a speedrunning challenge for players. Speed Berries have bronze, silver, and gold times, which require increasingly optimized completions of the map.  These appear in Spring Collab 2020 and a few other collabs.\n\n\"Alternate Sides\"  - It is common for maps to indicate that they are simply a harder version of another map by following it with a letter, followed by the word \u201cside.\u201d This is an expansion of the B-Side and C-Side system of the vanilla game. This is most commonly done with D-Sides.\n\n\u201cDifficulty\u201d \u00a0- Maps are generally categorized by difficulty. The five main difficulties are  \u201cbeginner\u201d ,  \u201cintermediate\u201d ,  \u201cadvanced\u201d ,  \u201cexpert\u201d , and  \u201cgrandmaster\u201d . (These are often abbreviated in order as beg/bg, int, adv, ex/exp, and gm) This difficulty delineation was popularized by Spring Collab 2020 and is the most widely used, including in Strawberry Jam.\n\nThe difficulties, in comparison to vanilla Celeste, are as follows:\n\nBeginner : \u00a0The same as most of the game\u2019s main story chapters (A-sides). Intermediate :  Most of the game\u2019s B-sides and C-sides fall in this category. Advanced : \u00a0 Some of Celeste\u2019s most difficult rooms reach low advanced territory. Expert : \u00a0Expert is beyond the difficulty of anything in vanilla Celeste. Grandmaster :  Grandmaster is also well beyond the difficulty of anything in vanilla.\n\nIn addition, c olors are used to denote the difficulties of maps found in these categories, green being the least difficult, yellow being in the middle, and red being the most difficult, indicated by an image of a meter. Additionally, maps that are notably harder than even the hardest GM maps are often referred to as GM+, and a cracked meter is used to represent these maps in collabs (see \u2018Cracked\u2019).\n\n\"Celestial\" \u00a0- The term \u201cCelestial\u201d is a suggested alternative to the gm+x format to indicate maps which are harder than grandmaster, but it is not widely used by the Celeste community.\n\n\u201cCracked\u201d \u00a0- Sometimes \u201ccracked red\u201d, these refer to maps given cracked difficulty, used in grandmaster maps to indicate maps that are beyond the typical spectrum of grandmaster difficulty. These maps are sometimes referred to as \u201cgm+\u201d. The number after \u2018gm+\u2019 indicates how many difficulty thresholds it is above a typical grandmaster level; for example, a gm+2 map is two difficulty categories above grandmaster, just like how advanced is two categories above beginner. Anything above gm+2 is seldom agreed upon. The term \u201ccracked\u201d comes from the fact that, in the difficulty color meter used in various collabs, the pointer is pushed so far to the right that it goes past red and causes the meter\u2019s glass cover to crack.\n\n\u201cLobby\u201d \u00a0- A map made for selecting other maps, frequently used in collabs. These are often sorted by difficulty (e.g. expert lobby, beginner lobby, etc.)\n\n\u201cGym\u201d  - Maps made solely for teaching techniques to players. These maps are common to include in collabs and are often sorted by difficulty, similarly to lobbies.\n\n\u201cHeart Side\u201d \u00a0- a type of map frequently placed at the end of a lobby in a  collab , popularized by Spring Collab. They  are typically \u00a0 a collection of  all the other maps in a lobby.  These maps are typically longer and more difficult than others in its difficulty category. These are frequently given prefixes to indicate what difficulty they are: \u201cBHS\u201d for beginner, \u201cIHS\u201d for intermediate, \u201cAHS\u201d for advanced, \u201cEHS\u201d or occasionally \u201cEXHS\u201d for expert, and \u201cGMHS\u201d for grandmaster. Oftentimes the \"heart\" portion is replaced by another word, such as the Winter Collab 2021 Fusionside serving as that  collab's \u00a0heart side.\n\n\u201cDashless\u201d  - Just as it sounds, these are maps or challenges that disallow Madeline from dashing.\n\n\u201cDark Map\u201d \u00a0- Describes a decoration style that turns tiles and entities into dark silhouettes to contrast the background. (e.g., Crimson Night, Heaven\u2019s Outer Space) (aka \"Silhouette Map\") . This may also refer to maps which obscure the map until lit up, such as the depths subchapter of chapter 5A from vanilla Celeste.\n\n\u201cEtselec\u201d \u00a0- Literally the word \u201cCeleste\u201d backwards, these maps are backwards versions of other maps, where rooms are completed in reverse order from end to beginning with minimal changes made to keep them possible. (See also, D1D7.)\n\n\u201cGarbage Version\u201d \u00a0- Modified versions of existing maps, but spammed with the moving saw blade entity from chapter 5. These maps are typically abbreviated with \u201c GV\u201d at \u00a0the end of their abbreviation. CMGV, for example, is a garbage version of the map Cycle Madness. Occasionally, Garbage Versions are made with the base of another Garbage Version, resulting in often TAS-only maps like CMGVGV and CMGVGVGV.\n\n\u201c Techspam\u201d -  A style of gameplay that revolves around using lots of tech in quick succession, typically with high input density. Maps using this style are usually expert or higher in difficulty due to the nature of it. An example of this style is the map \u201cS.B.W.W.\u201d.\n\n\u201cSave and Quit\u201d \u00a0(aka \u201cs+q\u201d, \u201cs&q\u201d, \u201cs and q\u201d, \u201csq\u201d)- Saving and quitting is an option in the Celeste pause menu. Selecting it brings the player to the main menu, wherein whenever they choose to continue, they will continue where they left off in a chapter. \u00a0Saving and quitting counts as a death and removes the player\u2019s golden strawberry if they have one.\n\n\u201cDreadcorner\u201d \u00a0- The name of a strategy in the chapter 5 B-side used to skip a portion of the chapter, performed by doing a spiked cornerjump on the right side of the room where Madeline would normally require using a red booster. It is called this, as it is the faster alternative to the \u2018bubsdrop\u2019 that can be performed in this room, but is much more difficult.", "image_urls": [], "image_captions": [], "cv_analysis": []}
