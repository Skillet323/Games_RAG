[ 2 ]  The game was released on January 25, 2018, for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Mac, and Linux. [ 3 ]  The game follows a young woman [ 4 ]  named  Madeline  as she climbs the somewhat magical Celeste Mountain, facing opposition from both the mountain's natural obstacles and from within herself.## GameplayCeleste's gameplay features fast and tight controls along a series of challenging platforming sublevels that make up a larger  Chapter . It follows the simple to learn and hard to master controls that are a staple of its genre, and gameplay has often been compared to others, like Super Meat Boy. [ 5 ]The  Prologue  introduces players to the basic controls, such as jumping and the ability to climb walls. The dash\u2014one of the main movement options in the game\u2014is gifted to the player at the end of the level, seemingly by the  Bird . This dash is the core mechanic of Celeste's gameplay, giving the player a short burst forward in the direction that the player is holding. It can only be used a limited number of times, and must be refreshed before dashing again. The status of the player's available dashes is indicated by Madeline's hair colour. Refreshing the dash is done in a multitude of ways, but the main actions include touching the ground, collecting  stamina crystals  and screen transitions.The sublevels, and by extension the game's Chapters, get progressively harder as more mechanics and obstacles are introduced, and the use of these elements merge and flow together the closer the player gets to the summit. Towards the endgame, Celeste introduces many more moves that use various combinations of the basic three moves (jumping, climbing, and dashing) in tandem; these techniques are explored in detail on the  Moves  page.## CollectiblesFor More Information, See article:   CollectiblesCollectibles in celeste are Strawberries, 175 Red Berries, 26 Golden Berries And 1  Moon Berry .

This game had 30 segments, with a total of 18 collectable strawberries. [ 7 ]  The game now referred to as Celeste was first playable at PAX West 2016, [ 2 ]  and the game itself was released January 25, 2018. [ 3 ]In December 2018, Thorson officially announced that Celeste would get a set of \"farewell levels\", which would be ready in early 2019. [ 8 ]  In January 2019, Thorson stated the new levels would consist of a single chapter with no alternate sides or strawberries. [ 9 ]  In April 2019, Thorson revealed that the chapter would be called Farewell, and would be a free DLC update on all platforms. [ 10 ]  In May 2019, Berry added that the chapter has something to do with the  Bird , but did not add further details. [ 11 ]  The final chapter was finally released in an update on the 9th of September 2019. The Pico-8 game\u2019s code can be found on Github.## ReceptionCeleste garnered positive reception from multiple review studios. IGN, the game's first reviewer, gave the game a 10/10, [ 12 ]  Polygon rated Celeste an 8/10, [ 13 ]  and the current standing on Metacritic is averaged 91% across its platforms, with an average user score of 7.3/10. [ 14 ]Celeste also was nominated for Game of the Year, next to God of War (the winner), Spider-Man, Red Dead Redemption 2, Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, and Monster Hunter World. Most notably though, this game has been received as though it was a love-letter to speedrunners. It became a common appearance at GDQ quite quickly, having 4 runs between 3 GDQs (two TAS, two human) [ 15 ] . On speedrun.com, this game often sits in the top ten most active speed games. [ 16 ]  As of July 2024, it now stands as the 4th most speedrun Game in History (On  speedrun.com ).Many people who have played this game have noted that it is a fantastic analogue for depression and anxiety. Jirard Khalil (host of the Completionist) stated, \"It's not the first video game about mental health, [and it's] not the first to use a mountain as a metaphor for one's personal struggles, but that doesn't matter because Celeste just knocks it right out of the park. [...] Now obviously, no two people are going to have the exact same experience when it comes to mental illness, [...] but it absolutely nails the feeling of trying to take care of your own mental and emotional health.\" [ 17 ]## Trivia- Noel Berry has stated that the name of the setting was chosen when Berry googled  British Columbian  mountains; the team chose  Mount Celeste  as they liked the name of it, despite not knowing much about the mountain at the time.

The speed can be set to any multiple of 10% between 50% and 160%.## Mirror ModeCauses the entire level to appear mirrored. It doesn't reverse the player's controls.## 360 DashingAllows the player to dash in any direction without being limited to certain angles, making it easier to do precise dashes with an analog stick. This feature has minimal effect on keyboard, only allowing the player to slightly alter their dash direction after dashing.This ability to change the direction of the dash can be coupled with the Super Dashing setting (and infinite air dashes if the player wishes to continue building speed) to allow the player to reach very high speeds very quickly. This can be done when the player dashes diagonally down, holding the direction they are moving in, then dashing diagonally up before the first dash is over, again holding the direction they are moving in. If the player wishes to continue gaining more speed, they can repeat this process.360 Dashing can also be paired with Super Dashing to allow the player to carry their momentum over very long distances.

The player will still be able to jump off of walls, and pressing the grab button will still trigger certain objects such as zippers.## Low FrictionCauses the ground and walls to become more slippery, making it harder for the player to stop their momentum or stay on walls. It can be seen very well when the player dashes through the surface of a platform. This also makes neutral jumping harder.## Super DashingMakes dashes last twice as long, allowing the player to reach much higher distances with them. It has no effect on dash-related techniques or tricks.## HiccupsMakes the character do constant hiccups, which make them bounce up slightly. They also make the player jump off of a wall or even stay in air for a split second if timed well. Crouching will slightly slow the rate at which hiccups occur.
